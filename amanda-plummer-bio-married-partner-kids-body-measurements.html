On 23 March 2017, she celebrated her 60th birthday. Plummer is the only child of Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes. She was born in the city of New York.</p><p>Amanda could not spend much time with her parents. They divorced when she was young and her mother remained in charge of raising her. Most of the contact she had with her father as a child was through his films.</p><p>It is believed that watching her father’s films and witnessing her mother’s involvement in acting inspired her to become involved in acting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Amanda-and-dad.jpg><p>Amanda Plummer graduated from United Nations High School in New York and attended Middlebury College. Before she attended college, she rehearsed classical music in her room. She talked about it once. She said:</p><p>“…music tells stories. I put on a record and went quietly. I kept putting the needle back on a certain segment because I hadn’t died well enough. I had to feel really, really dead. “</p><p>Amanda made her film debut as Annie in 1981 in Cattle Annie and Little Britches. She loves to act for movies but prefers the theatre. Amanda does not play roles that everybody likes. She likes devilish, thorny, dirty, and meaningful roles. For her, “this is where the drama is.”</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jenna Wolfe Bio, Facts, Married, Dating, Lesbian, Girlfriend</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Amanda Plummer Married, Partner, Kids</strong></h2><p>Amanda Plummer indeed celebrates her 66th birthday on March 23, 2023. Considering her age, many assume that she was once married and had children. Well, she is not, was never married, and has no children.</p><p>Nevertheless, she had something special with the Anglo-Irish stage and film actor Peter O’Toole. They say they fell in love after working together on several films and sharing the stage. Later, the news circulated that they had split up.</p><p>After O’Toole, she developed another romantic relationship with an English film director – Paul Chart. They were seen together on several occasions. But, it turned out that when most expected to end up as life partners, they decided to give up the relationship. No one knows what happened and Amanda has not been romantically involved with anyone since (the mid-1990s).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body Measurements</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Amanda-Plummer-Body-Measurements.jpg><p>Amanda Plummer’s height is 5 feet 4 inches tall.
