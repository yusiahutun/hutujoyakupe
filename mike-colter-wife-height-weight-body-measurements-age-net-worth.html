Even during his high school days, he was an active member of the drama club, where he refined and explored his acting skills. The actor has remained active and successful since the beginning of his professional acting career. He made his debut in Einsicht, an episode of the television series ER, in which he appeared as Watts.</p><p>However, the dark and handsome American actor is easily remembered for his role as Lemond Bishop in the television series The Good Wife, Malcolm Ward in Wrestling, and even more famously for his title role in Netflix and Marvel’s web and television series – Luke Cage, The Defenders and Jessica Jones.</p><p>Below are all the interesting details about Mike Colter, including his wife, height, weight, body measurements, age, wealth, and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mike Colter Brief Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>The actor, who belongs to an African-American ethnic group with American nationality, was born on August 26, 1976. He is the youngest of his parents’ five children – Eddie Lee Sr (father) and Freddie Marion Colter (mother). While his birthplace was Columbia, South Carolina, he grew up with his siblings in St. Matthews, South Carolina.</p><p>Mike Colter graduated from Calhoun County High School, where he was named the “most ambitious” student in his senior year. After spending a year at Benedict College, Colter moved on and received his BA in Theater Studies from the University of South Carolina, to which he was transferred in 1999. He continued his education at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, where he earned an MFA degree in acting. Armed with his academic qualifications and a burning passion for the arts, Colter took the film industry by storm.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Neil Degrasse Tyson Wife, Daughter, Family, Height, Net Worth, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Thanks to Denzel Washington’s outstanding performance in A Soldier’s Story, Colter knew from an early age which career path he wanted to pursue. Finally, he got his chance and started his acting career in the TV series ER, in which he played the character of Watts.</p><p>His debut role led to many others, and after playing short parts in TV series, he took his career to the next level and starred in high-profile movies like Million Dollar Baby as a boxer named Big Willie Little. In addition to his role in many television movies and the series – Wrestling, Colter also starred as a guest in Law & Order: Trial by Law & Order: Criminal Intent, The Good Wife, The Parkers, and more. He later joined the Halo franchise in 2014 with his role as Agent Jameson Locke.</p><p>The talented actor is related to the popular actress Viola Davis as a second cousin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Mike Colter Married to? Wife</strong></h2><p>Mike Colter has been married to Iva Colter since 2016, and on September 27, the same year the two were married, the actor revealed during a segment on the Wendy Williams Show that he and his wife had a daughter. When a picture of the actor and his wife appeared on the screen during the talk show, the audience suddenly stopped cheering in apparent disapproval. Remarkably, Iva is white, while Colter is a black man.</p><p>The decision to marry a white woman caused controversy and gave Colter his fair share of criticism. Apparently, interracial marriage is still not well received by many people. Nevertheless, Colter is prepared to defend his marriage in front of all the critics.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Christina Aguilera Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Kids, Husband</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mike Colter:&nbsp;Height, Weight, Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Paired with his black hair, which he normally shaves off, and a pair of enchanting dark brown eyes, Mike Colter, with a bodyweight of 90 kg and a height of 1.82 m and 3 cm, is a perfect match. His muscles and abs are also on the point with a chest measurement of 45 inches, a waist measurement of 36 inches, and his biceps that have grown to 15.5 inches. The shoe size of Mike Colter is 9.5 US.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What’s Mike Colter’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>With the kind of popularity he enjoys in the very lucrative film industry, it is expected that the actor must have made a fortune for himself. And he did. Although his salary is not known, there is no doubt that he takes home fat checks with an attractive net worth, estimated at around $2 million.</p><p>The actor’s net worth will surely add some more numbers as he is still very active in his acting career and other areas. Moreover, he still has his years ahead of him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqq3xGaaqKSkmr9uw8ifnGaglZ60qcCMsJyin5ipeqO7w7Jkpp2RqMKzscyepa2rXZa0pnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html&text=Mike%20Colter%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Colter%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Colter%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html&title=Mike%20Colter%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-colter-wife-height-weight-body-measurements-age-net-worth.html&description=Mike%20Colter%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Measurements%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexandre-rockwell-and-karyn-parsons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexandre Rockwell and Karyn Parsons">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./levee-breach-in-camanche-under-control-quickly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Levee breach in Camanche under control quickly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
