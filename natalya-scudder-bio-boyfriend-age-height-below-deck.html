So, keep scrolling down to learn more about her.</p><h3><strong>Meet Natalya Scudder, Stew On Below Deck Mediterranean</strong></h3><p>Natalya Scudder is one of the new faces in Below Deck Mediterranean season 7 which premiered on 11 July after nearly nine months since the last season. This season viewers will head to Malta. A new yacht named Home is the home of seven newbies. She is working as a third stew who is starring alongside other new casts Jason Gaskell (Deckhand), Storm Smith (Deckhand), Raygan Tyler (Bosun), Kyle Viljoen (second Stew), Dave White (Chef), and Natasha Webb (Chief Stew).</p><p>The returning members are Mzi “Zee” Dempers and Captain Sandy. The show revolves are a similar theme to the first six seasons that came before i.e. what it is like to work on a yacht and drama that sprouts when the crew members start working together. It is presently in its seventh season and has shown great growth in popularity since making its debut in 2016.</p><p>Some viewers might mistake her for Natasha Webb as they are almost a spitting image of one another. During the season 7 trailer, Natalya told viewers: “Is this my sister? Is this my twin?”. It also seems that Natalya could be bringing us the drama this year, as she hinted at a potential Below Deck lover.</p><p>Before the show premiered, Natalya announced on her Instagram, “Surprise! Don’t miss me on <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#BelowDeckMed</a> Monday, July 11th on&nbsp;<a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@BravoTV</a>! For the full trailer, head to BravoTV.com”.</p><h3><strong>Natalya Scudder Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Natalya Scudder’s accumulated net worth should be under $200 thousand.</p><p>At age 18, Natalya landed her first yachting position after establishing her skills and achieving the seemingly unattainable. She has since served as a Second Stew and Chief Stew on a number of various boats. She has served affluent clients, including several royal families, and no guest request has ever been too bizarre for her.</p><p>Natalya gained a distinctive and alarming perspective on the environmental problems facing the marine industry while working as a stewardess aboard the 55-meter Step One. She spoke with Boat International at the 2017 Monaco Yacht Show about her realization that single-use plastics can have a big detrimental impact on the ecosystem.</p><p>Natalya explained, “Last year when we were based in Costa Rica we had an incident where there was a turtle floating next to the yacht. It was just floating on the surface of the water so we decided to pull it out and we called the vet. It turns out that the turtle had swallowed a plastic bag”. She is committed to her work while still managing to be hilarious, whether she’s entertaining the guests or creating gorgeous tablescapes. She is also registered at <a href=#>Crew HQ</a>.</p><p>Besides her work in the yachting world, she is also striving to become an influencer. In February 2022 promoted <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@the_secret_skincare</a> products.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Natalya Scudder Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Natalya Scudder is private about her dating life. She hasn’t shared anything regarding her dating life on her social. On the show, she commented, “I am not openly looking for a boat romance, but Storm is looking nice at this point”. Interestingly, following her remark, a video of her kissing the new deckhand Storm Smith was presented.</p><p>These are only a few examples, and the “shipmances” of such megayacht reality shows usually don’t materialize in the real world. It is impossible to tell whether or whether their on-screen chemistry translated into real-life romance without one of them making a comment. Aside from this, Natalya appears content to keep the specifics of her dating life private.</p><p>Natalya is a young, tenacious woman who is totally committed to advancing in her work and discovering new locations with her friends and family.
