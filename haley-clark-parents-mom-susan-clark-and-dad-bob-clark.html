Learn more about her folks in this article. Their age, job, and current residence, this piece covers all the details.</p><p>So, keep on scrolling down to learn all that we know about Haley Clark’s parents.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Haley Clark Parents?</strong></h3><p>Haley Clark, the girlfriend of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, is the daughter of Susan Clark and Bob Clark. Her parents married in the spring of 1985, five years after they first met. The two had a strong bond and each often referred to the other as “their person”. The next few years saw the birth of three children.</p><p>The couple welcomed their daughter on 2 March 1989.</p><p>Haley studied <span class="t-14 t-normal"><span aria-hidden=true>Markets and Culture, Economics, Sociology at <span class="mr1 hoverable-link-text t-bold"><span class=visually-hidden>Southern Methodist University (Class of 2011). She was a sorority girl — as a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. </span></span></span></span>In 2023, she is working as <span class="mr1 hoverable-link-text t-bold"><span aria-hidden=true>Q Clothier | Rye 51 as </span></span><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Senior Director of Sales. She joined the company as Director of Sales in 2019.</span></p><p>As stated earlier, Haley made headlines after sparking romance rumors with the NFL star. After Haley shared numerous cuddly images with the ESPN analyst on Instagram Stories in June 2023, the couple fueled dating rumors. Haley and the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, however, gained attention after she shared a picture of herself kissing Troy on the cheek.</p><p>Meanwhile, Troy was hiding Haley in plain sight on his social media for months. Many of those now-private photographs show Haley and her new boyfriend on vacation off the Italian coast while they are both wearing swimsuits.</p><p>Haley previously revealed other images of their trip to Italy. One image has the couple grinning while on a yacht, with Haley wearing a yellow maxi dress that bares her midriff and wrapping her arm around the ESPN football analyst. In a second photo, the couple is beaming while traveling with others. According to Haley’s Instagram account, Troy Aikman’s college-aged children were on the yacht with their father and his new partner.</p><p>The brunette also posted a video of breakfast while on the opulent vacation, which also included trips to the island of Isola di Ponza, which is close to Rome, and Capri on the Almalfi Coast. The couple can be seen in an older shot on May 21 in affluent Del Mar, California, which is north of San Diego.</p><h3><strong>Meet Susan Clark, Haley Clark Mom</strong></h3><p>Susan Clark, Haley Clark’s mom, was born on 30 November 1956. She is the daughter of Natalie and Alex McKinnon.</p><p>Susan was the Putnam City High School valedictorian. She was a Kappa Alpha Theta sorority member while she was a student at the University of Oklahoma. She received recognition as the RUF/NEK Homecoming Queen and had numerous jubilant rides on the Sooner Schooner during OU football games. After earning a degree in fashion illustration from her formal schooling, she pursued a job in graphic design at nearby advertising businesses.</p><p>After having children, Susan became their full-time mother, a job she relished and at which she excelled. Susan was a mentor, advocate, and cheerleader for the family.</p><p>Sadly, Susan passed away on 31 July 2016. Before her death, she was looking forward to her role in helping plan her other daughter Courtney’s upcoming wedding to her fiance, Eric Merriman, of Dallas, Texas on October 1, 2016.</p><h3><strong>Meet Bob Clark, Haley Clark Dad</strong></h3><p>Robert “Bob” Clark Jr. is the father of Haley Clark. He is the president of RW Clark Inc. since 1988, the first commercial python breeder in the world that supplies zoos, institutes, and private collectors.</p><p>Because his job is a little unconventional, people often inquire what piqued his interest in breeding reptiles. He answers, “I didn’t get that way, I WAS that way!” I really don’t remember a time when I wasn’t trying to catch, keep or breed some kind of reptile. My parents were supportive but, that said, we had the “no snakes rule” at our house. I kept mostly turtles in those days. My grandfather would bring me box turtles he found crossing the road. I’d keep them until they escaped the flimsy outdoor enclosures I’d constructed for them.”</p><p>Bob kept pursuing his interest through high school and college, eventually getting a BS in Biology from the University of Kansas and a Master’s Degree in Herpetology there as well. He worked full-time in a clothing store till 1988.</p><p>He later partnered with reptile dealer Tom Crutchfield and left his job in a clothing store in 1988 to become a full-time breeder.</p><p>According to his <a href=#>website</a>, he breeds ball pythons, blood pythons, Burmese pythons, reticulated pythons, and many more.</p><p>Bob was born on 3 July 1955, so he is currently 67 years old.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Long Were Haley Clark Parents Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Haley Clark’s parents were married for more than three decades.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Did Haley Clark Parents Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Haley Clark’s dad currently resides in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (originally from <span class=xt0psk2>Leawood, Kansas</span>).
