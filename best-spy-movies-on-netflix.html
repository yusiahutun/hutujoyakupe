You might hear of one working for the CIA or KGB, a military spy or even a corporate spy sent to collect information about competitors. But who wants to know of these nail-biting current events from the real world when all you have to do is turn on Netflix for intrigue.</p><p>It’s a genre the popular streaming service offers its viewers that’s filled with duplicity, deception, plot twists and missions that might seem impossible.

The spy drama’s title is a variant of “a call to arms.” Though heavily fictionalized, the content is inspired by real life events of the three women who helped undermine the Nazi regime in France.</p><p><strong>MUST-READ:</strong> <a href=#>‘Castle’ Cast Then and Now: Where the Stars Are Now And What They Think of a Return</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What list of spy films would be complete without a mention of Mission: Impossible? Things seem to be breaking down at a fast clip in this film — messages linger and don’t self-destruct, the mask machine is kaput, the Kremlin gets blown up.</p><p>And then, the IMF is completely shut down when it’s implicated in the Kremlin bombing, resulting in the franchise team going rogue to clear their organization’s name. In comes Ethan Hunt (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Cruise</a>) to save the day, despite the fact he’s getting the blame for laying the bomb at the Kremlin’s feet.
