But Juyeon took me to his place and took care of me, so I was very thankful for that,” he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">You won’t believe the crazy gifts BTS fans bought Jimin for his birthday</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Stealer and future goals</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now that they’re on their way and topping charts, their newest comeback single The Stealer brings a whole different vibe to the group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The concept of ‘Chase’ is two people chasing each other,” said Juyeon. “What’s great about our songs is the fun lyrics.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Q also added that in this comeback, rather than there being a point move – the most significant dance move in the choreography – they tried to express the intro, middle and last hooks of The Stealer in various ways. In other words, to have more storytelling and ease in the way that they danced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Boyz also expressed their hope that fans would see their strength in a variety of aspects. “We don’t just want to show one concept, but to show that we can grow into all kinds of concepts – a sexy boy, cute boy, cool boy,” said New.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leader Sangyeon, meanwhile, would like the group to try out a vibe that’s warmer and more artistic, similar to Exo’s 2013 release “Miracles in December”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The members also revealed that although they are currently focused on group activities, they would want to release solo music if given the opportunity. “Even though there aren’t official solo debuts, we have a little bit of that on our YouTube channel ‘A to Boyz’, where we showcase individual members in their own elements. So far we’ve had Jacob, Hyunjae, Q, Juyeon and Sunwoo, and we’d like to show other members’ individual skills through that platform, too,” Kevin said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Their love of fashion and hidden talents</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One perk of being an idol is, of course, sporting hairstyles and outfits that you never would otherwise. Jacob wants to try out a long hairstyle, while Hyunjae hopes to bring back his permed hair from the Giddy Up music video.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When they aren’t performing, though, the group prefers a more understated approach. “Our stage outfits are usually hype and not too comfortable, so we just wear cool, comfortable clothes in our daily lives,” said Eric. “I also personally like to wear hats to cover up my hair and face.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Exclusive interview: K-pop star Jamie Park’s roller coaster 2020</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Boyz might not be shy about showing off their sense of style, or their vocal and performance skills, but they still have talents that fans have yet to see. Kevin told us that he used to play the saxophone when he was 12, while Eric played the violin for five years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Juyeon and Ju Haknyeon, on the other hand, have licenses in scuba diving and horseback riding, respectively.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Missing The Bs</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eric’s biggest hope is to be able to do live concerts and meet-ups with fans again. But the pandemic has a silver lining, added Kevin: “We had our first online solo concert as a group, which brought in over two million viewers. If you look on the bright side, more fans had the chance to see us, and we had a chance to show more people what we have [to offer].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group has also been active on live broadcasting app V Live and K-pop idol and entertainment agency forum Fancafe now that quarantine protocols have been put into place. “SNS [social media networks] is our biggest option right now, so we do more Twitter, Instagram and Fancafe,” said Jacob. “We upload a lot of pictures for our fans because we know that they miss us and they want to see us somehow.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Boyz also hold promotional video call events through FaceTime to communicate with fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their quarantine recommendations for The Bs? Clean up their homes, get into making trendy beaded accessories, or maybe even adopt pet goldfish like Q. Oh, and make sure their playlists are filled with their favourite The Boyz songs, especially Lucid Dream and tracks from recent release “Chase”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They also had plenty of good things to say about each other’s solo work: Haknyeon suggested that fans check out Kevin’s solo Half, while New recommended Jacob’s covers on A to Boyz. When it came to other music artists, Kevin highlighted Bazzi’s I.F.L.Y.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I like Forgive Myself by Shaylen,” added Jacob. “I love the meaning behind the song so I hope you guys also listen to it.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Holland, K-pop’s first openly gay idol – 10 things to know</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group also expressed their love for fans, saying that their only wish for The Bs these days is for them to be happy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We know that times are tough right now, but I truly hope that you will be able to find something that makes you happy,” said Jacob. “Whether through hobbies or your job, whatever you’re doing, we hope that you’re staying positive. If you really need something to look forward to, look forward to The Boyz – watch our stuff, get to know us better. We’re also going to work really hard to continue doing what we’re doing, to get us out in the world. Thank you so much for supporting us. Please stay strong!”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
