He is not only a Duke but also an actor who has already achieved several successes. He only became world-famous after marrying the American actress Beverly D’Angelo. Although his marriage to the actress did not last the expected time, Don became the object of media and public attention.</p><p>Several years have passed since the divorce and Don is still the subject of media attention. Many are interested in his career, his parents, his relationship, and several other interesting details.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Everything About Don Lorenzo Salviati: He Is The Ex-Husband Of Beverly D’Angelo</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Meet Xen Martin: Tisha Campbell And Duane Martin’s Autistic Son</a></b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>An Italian Aristocrat Don Lorenzo Salviati Is A Descendant Of Lorenzo De’ Medici</b></h2><p>Few people know this, but Don Lorenzo Salviati comes from a high-class Italian family. He is an Italian Duke and one of the descendants of the Italian statesman Lorenzo de Medici.</p><p>Don Lorenzo Salviati was born on 10 March 1957 in Rome, Italy, to Don Foroze Salviati and his mother Maria Grazia Gavronska. His father is the 5th Duke of Don Lorenzo Salviati, Marquis of Montieri, and Boceggiano, Nobile Romano Coscritto.</p><p>He is survived by two sisters, Donna Maria Oliva and Donna Dianora.</p><p>As regards his education, Lorenzo is reported to have studied business at the University of Southern California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Don Lorenzo Salviati Was Married To an Actress</b></h2><p>The handsome Don Lorenzo Salviati won huge acclaim for his marriage to the successful actress Beverly D’Angelo. The couple married over the 1981 Labour Day weekend. Don and Beverly’s wedding was a secret ceremony held on a yacht during a cruise with their friend. The two had not informed anyone about it except for a few friends who were with them on the cruise.</p><p>However, their cruise marriage, which was supposed to be a romantic event, turned into an adventure. In recounting the day, Beverley points out that it did not occur to either of them to tell anyone about their <a href=# rel=noopener>marriage plan</a>, and explains how the beautiful occasion turned into what she calls a “Poseidon adventure”. She said, “Beveron is a very kind and extraordinary person.</p><p>Soon after their escape, the newlyweds went to a chapel in Las Vegas. After their marriage, the duo lived on Lorenzo’s 7000-acre estate near Pisa. They later moved to a rented 12-room house in Pacific Palisades.</p><p>Eventually, however, things got worse for the couple. After almost 3 years of marriage, they ended their relationship and divorced in 1984. Their divorce was finalized in 1995. Speaking about her <a href=# rel=noopener>failed marriage</a>, Beverly once stated,</p><p>When I was married to Larry, I kept thinking, ‘This is a bad marriage, but it would make a terrific mini-series.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>How Did They First Meet?</b></h2><p>Although Lawrence and D’Angelo are no longer together, they first met in 1980 at a party. After the wedding, the Italian Duke Don announced that he had met Beverly at one of those parties where “you bring a spare cocktail dress and get home after the day”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Salviati’s Ex-Wife Beverly Has Two Children With Al Pacino</b></h2><p>Her relationship with <a href=#>Al Pacino</a> can be considered one of her high-profile relationships. The two started dating in 1997 and were in a relationship for about five years until 2003.</p><p>The former partners even had twins through artificial insemination – a son, Anton James Pacino, and a daughter, Olivia Pacino. Born on January 25, 2001.</p><p>Just to add to this, Al Pacino also has a daughter, Julie Marie Pacino, born in his relationship with Jan Tarrant. She was born on 16 October 1989.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Other Relationship With Beverly</b></h2><p>After her divorce from Lorenzo, Beverly became involved in several relationships. Shortly after her divorce, she met the Irish writer and film director Neil Jordan.</p><p>Later, she became romantically involved with the Academy Award-winning stage designer Anton Furst, who died by suicide in 1991.</p><p>Before her marriage to Don Lawrence, she also met director Milos Forman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Lorenzo Divorced Beverly Because She Wanted To Marry Al Pacino</b></h2><p>Not many people know, but Don reportedly divorced his ex-wife Beverly because she wanted him to. In a recent interview in 2022, Beverly D’Angelo revealed that Don broke up with her because she was in love with the “Father of God” actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Did Don Lorenzo Salviati Marry Again?</b></h2><p>Many people want to know if Don Lorenzo Salviati was married after his divorce from Beverly. Well, there are no authentic statements to this effect, but there is speculation that he married a woman named Valentina Bonomo.</p><p>Not only that but there is also speculation that he had a son from his rumored marriage to Valentina, named Don Francesco Trout.</p><p>In light of this, we hope that Don will come out publicly to talk about his current relationship status.</p><p>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Joy McManigal?
