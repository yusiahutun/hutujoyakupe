So, if he wants to experience that, I'm OK with that."</p><p>The 69-year-old further added that she is truly "committed to Rex" even though she doesn't "have much faith in being bound by a piece of paper or ring."</p><p>According to the news outlet, finding love with Linn has had a profound impact on McEntire's confidence. "When you do love yourself, that means you're confident, you're comfortable," she said. "You love yourself, and it's easier to love others." <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><img alt="Reba McEntire and Rex Linn (Getty)" title="Reba McEntire and Rex Linn (Getty)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713242407_untitled-design-2024-04-16t101326-792.jpg></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>McEntire's advocacy for self-confidence aligns with her collaboration with Dove, marking 20 years of celebrating authentic beauty and rejecting the use of AI in advertisements.</p><p>"That's a great thing," McEntire emphasized, "because in my industry, that's what we're finding right now: We want to be presented as ourselves."</p><p>McEntire and Linn have known each other since 1991, but their romantic relationship didn't blossom until the singer guest-starred on Linn's show, Young Sheldon, in 2020. Their chemistry was palpable from the start, especially evident during their post-filming dinner. Recalling their chemistry, the singer told E! News, "It was just like a magnet."</p><p>She continued, "We didn't get to see each other from January 'til June 16, but we created an intimacy by texting and talking over the telephone that we wouldn't have gotten if we'd have been together all of that time. We've been pretty much inseparable ever since June 16 of, 2020."</p><p>The Country Music icon expressed gratitude for the opportunity to build intimacy through text and phone calls, allowing them to truly understand each other's personalities before diving into a romantic relationship.</p><p>"You know the ins and outs of their personality and their faults…You love them for the way they are instead of it being a total attraction and sizing them up because of appearance," McEntire explained.</p><p>&nbsp;Before her current relationship with Linn, McEntire was married twice, initially exchanging vows with Charlie Battles in 1976. Reflecting on their relationship, the singer stated, "I loved Charlie with all my heart; I wanted to marry him [...] We had a lot of fun."</p><p>However, despite the joy they shared, they parted ways in 1987 after 11 years of marriage, with McEntire choosing her career over her marriage.</p><h2 id=661eb23db7aa8><strong>Who is Reba McEntire's boyfriend Rex Linn?</strong></h2><p>Rex Maynard Linn is an American film and television actor.
