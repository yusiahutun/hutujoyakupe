You don't have to sing, you just have to look horrified."</p><p>"That's what we did and it was just really, really fun."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25383559.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_heavenbanner21.jpg><p>She also revealed the heartwarming dedication that John Challis had put into learning the song especially for the episode and the sweet gift that she received after her appearance, saying: "His wife sent me video footage of him learning the song in his hotel room, which was very touching."</p><p>Asked if she would ever consider making any further cameos on TV, there was one programme that the star revealed that she would love to appear in - <a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>The Masked Singer</a>.</p><p>"I'd love to, but I haven't been asked," said Carol, adding: "I'm surprised I haven't been asked, but I haven't been approached yet. I love that show. I think it's huge fun."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>However before Carol makes any further steps into the world of TV, she is back on the road for The Essential Eighties Tour with fellow musicians Paul Young and Hue & Cry.</p><p>Speaking of the tour, she said: "It will just be a lovely combination of songs you remember by the original artists. It's something that people really enjoy.</p><p>"I'll probably stick to my classic eighties hits, as this is what this tour is all about. Give the folks what they're hoping to hear."</p><p>Carol Decker's classic hits including the chart-topping smash China In Your Hand with T'Pau, which spent a huge five weeks at number one in 1987.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26247045.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Benidorm.jpg><p>Surprisingly though, despite being one of their biggest records from their debut album Bridge Of Spies, Carol revealed that the song was a last minute addition, saying: "It's now a recognised classic, which is phenomenal.</p><p>"I never knew it was going to turn into that song - in fact, we hadn't written China In Your Hand when we got our record deal. We got it off songs like Valentine and Heart And Soul.</p><p>"We were in the studio in America, just outside of Chicago, and one song wasn't working and we had to dump it.</p><p>She went on to explain: "Roy Thomas-Baker, our producer, said have you got anything else? So before we flew out, Ronnie [Rogers] and I were continuing to write and I literally had a very basic vocal, first version of China In Your Hand.</p><p>"I hadn't even finished the lyrics. I said to Roy, I've got this, and he said that's a great song."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26247055.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Lovely-Jubbly.jpg><p>The song hit the top of the charts around the world, with T'Pau going on to sell out arenas - but not before the group found unlikely inspiration for their unique band name.</p><p>"One day I had the TV on and it was an episode of Star Trek. I was listening to it in the background and all I could hear was this T'Pau, T'Pau, T'Pau.</p><p>"I turned around and paid attention and she was a Vulcan High Priestess. She sat on the Intergalatic Council.</p><p>"I liked the name and I checked we could use it from a legal perspective, and I said I've got this word, T'Pau. I always say it's the one they hated the least, but I loved it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26247058.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Rewind-North-Festival.jpg><p>She described how since then, many Star Trek fans have gotten in touch with the band, recalling one humorous encounter while on a press tour in the eighties.</p><p>"I had one journalist and we were on a press junket in a big hotel, he came in for his ten minutes, went into his briefcase and without referring to them at all, he brought out this pair of pointy plastic ears, put them on and began to interview me," said Carol.</p><p>"Never referred to them once. He said thank you, took his ears, off put them back in his briefcase and left."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26247063.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Photo-of-Carol-DECKER-and-TPAU.jpg><p>During their eighties heyday, she also met future friend Paul Young, who will be joining Carol on The Essential Eighties Tour.</p><p>On meeting him for the first time, Carol said: "He came as a guest to our aftershow party in 1988. We had sold out Wembley. He was just drop dead gorgeous. He's such a big star and has this aura around him. He's such a nice man.</p><p>"2001 was the first tour I did with him and Kim Wilde. It's the last 20 years we've become friends and we're frequently on the same festival bills.</p><p>"To do an actual tour with him will be super fun. We get on really well and he's a super nice man."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26213178.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-169681216.jpg><p>Looking ahead to the The Essential Eighties Tour, Carol said she cannot wait to get back on the road and delight fans with her hit records once more, as well as reuniting with her fellow artists.</p><p>"Backstage we'll just have a glass of wine and a chat. Everybody these days is more mellow. You can't be partying before you onstage!</p><p>"There'll be a glass of wine for sure and a chat. It's very nice. Everyone is very supportive of each other."</p><p>She added: "We have this saying, don't bore us, get to the chorus. There were some really great songs written and performed by some unique artists. For me to be a little part of that is a huge compliment.</p><p>"It's a pleasure that people still want to come and hear those songs. I think it does mean a lot when the original artists are singing them."</p><p><i>PAUL YOUNG, T'PAU & HUE AND CRY WILL PERFORM AS PART OF THE ESSENTIAL 80'S UK TOUR IN AUTUMN 2022 - TICKETS ARE ON SALE
