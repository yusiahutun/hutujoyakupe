If arrested, hawkers face a penalty of about HK$450 and the loss of their stock. "When the officers attack, I just leave my goods and run," said Liu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The market is an oasis in the isolated community, which has become notorious for its domestic violence, murders and suicides. The town is a figurative prison, rife with cross-generational poverty and geographically isolated: a round-trip bus ride to Central takes three hours and costs HK$42.80.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Social worker Thomas Kong Kin-shing of the Community Development Alliance explains why Tin Shui Wai - with 60 per cent of its 300,000 residents living in public housing - is different from other new towns born through the government's urban planning scheme. "Tin Shui Wai used to be farmland before it was developed, so there were no street-side, local-style stores," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, in the northern half of Tin Shui Wai - where the public housing estates are concentrated - daily necessities can be bought only in malls run by The Link Reit, the real estate investment trust that runs shopping malls on public housing estates all over the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Link has been accused of squeezing out small businesses by pushing up rents, and stores in the mall are criticised for charging exorbitant prices due to the lack of competition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The hawkers, therefore, offer an alternative to Tin Shui Wai's impoverished residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are breaking the monopoly," said Liu, who lives in a tenement overlooking the dawn market in Tin Yan Estate. But the constant fear of having to flee from hawker-control officers causes him emotional distress. "My heart is always unsettled," Liu said, breaking down in tears. "We just want to make a bit of money to put food on the table, but we are treated like thieves."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">(SCMP video by Helene Franchineau)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Five years ago, 65-year-old Chinese-herb hawker Lo Kong-ching drowned when he jumped into the nullah to escape pursuing officers. After that the officers became less zealous.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liu said when the officers stroll up to the market slowly the hawkers understand they must leave quickly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But you never know. When the officers start running like an arrow from different directions toward the market, then you know they're out to arrest people," he said. "Just a few days ago, they arrested four hawkers."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last Saturday, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor made a surprise announcement that the government would establish a flea market to be run by the non-profit Tung Wah Group of Hospitals by next year. It will be on a separate plot of unused land near Tin Sau Road Park, 500 metres away from the nullah.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There will be 200 stalls charging proposed rents of HK$800 to HK$1,000, and this has drawn interest from residents beyond the dawn market hawkers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kong said a group of social workers had been pushing for the authorisation of the bank- side hawker market for the past three years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said working as a hawker, despite its stress, offered an attractive business opportunity: "Many people see being a hawker as offering upward mobility in society." At a time when labour laws do not ensure job security, working as a hawker was an entrepreneurial chance to break out of cross-generational poverty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The hawker market is a ray of hope in the bleak neighbourhood once labelled a "city of sadness" - a term that came into circulation after a notorious tragedy in 2004 when an unemployed man, living in the Tin Heng Estate, killed his wife and two daughters before ending his own life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spurred on by this incident and the many cases of crime and domestic abuse being reported in the district, the authorities have since pledged more resources to improve the living conditions for Tin Shui Wai's beleaguered residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the town remains steeped in poverty and ennui, with many living on social welfare. The biting irony is that low-income residents must pay for expensive items in stores run by The Link. Liu calls it "the rich robbing the poor".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The social worker said many of the current hawkers were worried that the government had been using Yuen Long's Kam Sheung Road tourist flea market as a point of reference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The alliance is demanding the residents be a part of the planning for Tung Wah's authorised market. "We don't need a market selling jewellery and accessories to tourists. We need one that sells cheap daily essentials to locals," Kong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">District councillor Luk Chung-hung adds: "Having an authorised hawker market will mean residents can work in jobs other than as a waiter, janitor or security guard... It's worth noting that 91 per cent of Yuen Long district residents are employed in jobs outside the district, so a hawker market means creating jobs in the neighbourhood."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most of the hawkers are housewives, who are earning a bit of extra cash to support their working husbands. A 47-year-old mother of three, who goes by the name of "Big Sister Ping", said she sells children's clothes to support her husband, who is a construction worker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The timing is flexible, I drop my children off at school and come straight to the market," said Ping, who migrated from the mainland in 2008 to join her family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But it's not just about making money, it's about the friendships I've made," said the effervescent woman. "I befriended one of my female customers one time, and she shared with me that her husband had been cheating on her with another woman."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The customer disclosed to Ping that she was planning to throw acid at the other woman. Ping and a few friends sat her down and successfully talked her out of it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As she chats with the , a woman customer walks past and shouts: "Big Sister Ping, you're dressed nice today. If I was a man, I'd hit on you." She chuckles, and replies humbly: "This top was only HK$30."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ping's life now is a far cry from her former career as a primary-school teacher on the mainland. "When friends back home ask me if it's really that miserable in Hong Kong that I have to be a hawker and dodge officers, I tell them no, because of all the friends I've made.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I also don't know what else to do to kill time. Unlike other women, I don't like to play mahjong."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And even as she tells of how the hawker-officer chases leave her shaken for days, her exuberant smile reveals her determination to find serenity in the town of sky and water.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Hawkers fight to brighten grim lives</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQaWpqaGRpfLW1zWaqoa2ZYsSitYywn56qlWK1osPKnqmsZZiaubF5waugoKCkmrtus9GipGakmauytA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html&text=Tin%20Shui%20Wai%2c%20where%20hawkers%20help%20brighten%20up%20grim%20lives&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html&title=Tin%20Shui%20Wai%2c%20where%20hawkers%20help%20brighten%20up%20grim%20lives" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html&title=Tin%20Shui%20Wai%2c%20where%20hawkers%20help%20brighten%20up%20grim%20lives" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html&title=Tin%20Shui%20Wai%2c%20where%20hawkers%20help%20brighten%20up%20grim%20lives" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftin-shui-wai-where-hawkers-help-brighten-grim-lives.html&description=Tin%20Shui%20Wai%2c%20where%20hawkers%20help%20brighten%20up%20grim%20lives" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./usher-files-for-divorce-from-wife-grace-miguel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Usher Files for Divorce from Grace Miguel After 3 Years of Marriage">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-oc-cast-then-vs-now-gallery-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The OC then vs now: See how the cast have changed over the years">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
