It's not exactly subtle, but it needs asking: "How big are they?"</p><p>Long-suffering Lucy's obviously used to it. She breaks into a dirty great grin. "They're 32FF. They used to be 32G but they're going down a bit as I get older." She's 24.</p><p>Are they all God's own handiwork? "Absolutely, they are 100 per cent real. They always generated a reaction. When I was at school, just 13, I'd cram them into these white school shirts. Pupils and teachers just didn't know where to look. Luckily I was calm about myself. I always felt quite comfortable being busty."</p><p>*** COP A LOAD OF OUR SUPER HOT STAR BABES IN OUR INCREDIBLE BABES GALLERY! ***</p><p>Now that's sorted, I pitch in with pressing question Number Two. Is it really true that Lucy was just discovered quietly sunbathing on Bournemouth beach? Or is it all a myth, a harmless fairy story?</p><p>Lucy laughs her pretty head off. "It is completely and utterly true. It was the gorgeous hot summer of 2003. I was working as a secretary prior to going off to uni. The weather was so fantastic I threw a sickie and sneaked off to the beach with my friends.</p><p>"Actually, I was looking awful that day. I didn't have any make-up on. I had crap sunglasses. I wasn't even wearing a bikini - I couldn't find one to fit my boobs. So I was sprawled out on the sand with my mates in a ropey black bra. I was shocked when a bloke came up and asked if he could take some pictures."</p><p>Yes, Lucy, but they weren't just jolly holiday snaps, were they? "No, they weren't, far from it. He wanted me to take my top off. I just said: ‘You're having a laugh'."</p><p>So what happened to change Lucy's mind? "I don't know why I did it, but I'm glad I did."</p><p>Didn't she worry about what her mum and dad would say? "Of course I was worried. Becoming a glamour model was the last thing on my mind and I certainly hadn't prepared them for the prospect of seeing their darling daughter wearing next to nothing, plastered all over the papers."</p><p>Lucy's parents didn't have much chance to get used to the idea. Once the Bournemouth pictures hit the Daily Star, pandemonium broke out.</p><p>"I was in shock. Something I'd done for fun suddenly turned serious. There I was, all ready to go off to uni to study English Literature, media and film and suddenly I was offered a contract for big money. Because of that one sickie my entire life changed."</p><p>Readers couldn't get enough of Lucy. She was inundated with attention. Meanwhile, in the background, her carpenter boyfriend Daniel was forced to make a few major decisions of his own.</p><p>"We'd been going out three years when Bournemouth beach happened. Suddenly I went from his private girlfriend with giant private boobs to this girl whose jugs were being talked about all over the place.</p><p>"Luckily, he's a very secure man. He just said: ‘Go for it. As long as you're happy and no-one's forcing you to do anything.' Frankly, I've always had huge boobs, men had always drooled all over me, so he'd had to get over the jealousy thing ages ago."</p><p>Then, of course, there's NippleGate. For years, Lucy kept her nipples under wraps. Last April, she finally dusted them off and allowed them to be photographed in all their glory. Why tantalise her fans for so long?</p><p>"Well, when I started off, I still thought I'd be going off to uni. I didn't like the idea of other under-graduates being familiar with my nipples, so I didn't show them. Then, it became a sort of trademark - Lucy doesn't do nipples.</p><p>*** GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH OUR HOTTEST BABES ON VIDEO! ***</p><p>"Then it turned into a total pain to keep them covered up at shoots. I got paranoid in case one popped out. Finally, I decided to yank them out. I'm glad to say the response was quite favourable."</p><p>It's typical of Lucy Pinder to use words like "quite favourable" when she really means "the crowd went wild".</p><p>She's modest, down to earth and still conveys a sense of amazement that any of this has happened to her in the first place.</p><p>"I'm not insanely ambitious. I doubt I'd do a reality TV show. They're OK if you're born into showbiz, but we're really normal. I cook dinner. I chill out with my three cats. I hang out with family and friends."</p><p>Understated Lucy doesn't even have her sights set on a massive celebrity wedding. "There'll be no marriage in the near future. It would be lovely some time, but I find it difficult to justify spending all that money on just one day."</p><p>She's not ready to play Mr And Mrs and Lucy doesn't fancy playing mummies and daddies either. "My cats are enough for me at the moment."</p><p>Meanwhile Lucy's naughty and loving it. "Daniel and I are still seriously sexually attracted to each other. Sometimes I just look at him and pounce. Sometimes I get in my pyjamas and snuggle. Sometimes he gets me out of my pyjamas and what happens next is X-rated and censored.</p><p>"I have the same urges as the next girl, but unlike some young ladies in my profession, I don't feel the need to bang on about it."</p><p>So what is Lucy Pinder like? She's the girl every red-blooded bloke wishes lived next door.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOnq%2BcpKWotrexjKWsnLFdpbavsMSrZJynppq%2FprCMrqdmaWhlfXGCj3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html&text=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Lucy%20Pinder%3a%20%27Why%20I%20covered%20up%20for%20so%20long%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Lucy%20Pinder%3a%20%27Why%20I%20covered%20up%20for%20so%20long%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Lucy%20Pinder%3a%20%27Why%20I%20covered%20up%20for%20so%20long%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Lucy%20Pinder%3a%20%27Why%20I%20covered%20up%20for%20so%20long%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-lucy-pinder-covered-up-18000607.html&description=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Lucy%20Pinder%3a%20%27Why%20I%20covered%20up%20for%20so%20long%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./caitlin-clark-going-pro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Caitlin Clark Going Pro?
