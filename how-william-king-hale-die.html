The book recounts the series of murders of the Osage which William King Hale and his nephew Ernest Burkhart were the masterminds behind it. On why he decided to pursue a film adaptation of the Osage murders, Scorcese told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://deadline.com/2023/10/martin-scorsese-interview-killers-of-the-flower-moon-leonardo-dicaprio-robert-de-niro-1235359006/>Deadline</a>, “What I responded to when I read David Grann’s book was the natural order of things. The idea that one could rationalize that if the Osage are not going to be of any use, if they’re going to be phased out anyway, why don’t we just, you know, help them go? And, ultimately, do we really feel any guilt for that?”</p><p><a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/leonardo-dicaprio-vittoria-ceretti/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> initially was signed on to star as FBI agent Tom White but Scorcese decided he should play Burhart. “Leo DiCaprio looked at me and said, “Where’s the heart in this movie?” This was when Eric Roth and I were writing the script from the point of view of the FBI coming in and unraveling everything. Look, the minute the FBI comes in, and you see a character that would be played by Robert De Niro, Bill Hale, you know he’s a bad guy. There’s no mystery. So, what is it? A police procedural? Who cares! We’ve got fantastic ones on television.”</p><p>Robert De Niro who plays Hale in the movie, told the publication how it was <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1391564/tiffany-chen-robert-de-niro/ rel="noreferrer noopener">important</a> to tell the story. “It made the most sense to show what’s going on in that world, the dynamic between the nephew and the uncle,” he said. “I don’t know if you would call it the banality of evil, or just evil, corrupt entitlement, but we’ve seen it in other societies, including the Nazis before WWII. That is, a depressing realization of human nature that leaves people capable of doing terrible things. [Hale] believed he loved them, and felt they loved him. But within that, he felt he had the right to behave the way he did.”</p><p>He continued, “Tom White and the FBI set up law and order in the Wild West, where laws were made by the people who were right there and felt they could do anything. They were entrenched in the community, and nobody was accountable. It was racism, really.”&nbsp;</p><p>So what happened to William King Hale after the murders and how did he die?

Hale moved to Arizona after he was granted parole on July 31, 1947. He died in a nursing home on August 15, 1962.</p><p>William King Hale rose to power after trading with the Osage Native Americans and was dubbed “King of the Osage Hills. In a memo to J. Edgar Hoover, White wrote, “Eventually (Hale) became a millionaire, who dominated local politics and seemingly could not be punished for any of the many crimes. His method of building up power and prestige was… by means of gifts and favors.” The Osage people became wealthy after oil was found on their land and inherited head rights to the oil fortune. Burkhart’s wife Mollie and her siblings had several head rights and Burkhart and his uncle conspired to kill the Osages. A decomposed body of Anna Brown—an Osage Native American—was found in a remote ravine in northern Oklahoma which led to more deaths within the family.</p><p>Hale claimed to be innocent throughout the investigation, in trial and while he was in prison. On January 26, 1929, Hale was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Henry Roan by Judge Kennamer. He was later paroled in 1947 after serving only two decades of his sentence.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfnby4edaio6WhkaJ6rLXNoGShmZyaeqW1xGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html&text=How%20Did%20William%20King%20Hale%20Die%3f%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Him%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html&title=How%20Did%20William%20King%20Hale%20Die%3f%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html&title=How%20Did%20William%20King%20Hale%20Die%3f%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html&title=How%20Did%20William%20King%20Hale%20Die%3f%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-william-king-hale-die.html&description=How%20Did%20William%20King%20Hale%20Die%3f%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nude-model-deep-despair-over-photo-leaked-south-korea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nude model in deep despair over photo leaked in South Korea">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./basketball-wives-evelyn-lozada-chad-johnson-violent-marriage-domestic-abuse-arrest-er-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How did Evelyn Lozada end up in ER?
