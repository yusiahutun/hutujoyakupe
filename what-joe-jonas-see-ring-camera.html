While oh-so-casually modeling with a unicorn for Harper’s Bazaar UK, Turner explained that she and Jonas had quite a few mutual friends try to set them up, but it just never ended up happening. She said it must have been fate, though, because “[they] were following each other on Instagram, and he direct messaged [her] one fine day, out of the blue.” Bold move! But clearly, it worked in his favor. It’s also a technique that the JoBros seem to really like. Nick Jonas slid into his now-wife’s Twitter DMs with the line, “I think we should connect.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-stormi-bree.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-peregrine-pearson.png><p>A year later, he popped the question, and they got married in Vegas in 2019. Their first child, daughter Willa, was born in 2020 and their second, another daughter, in 2022. “It’s been amazing to be a dad and to learn every day more about myself and what that’s like,” Jonas&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;at the time. “It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation,” Turner told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elle</a>&nbsp;UK. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”</p><p>But after news broke over the Labor Day 2023 weekend that he’d hired a divorce lawyer and that footage of what she said or did was the catalyst for their split, everyone has theories on what Joe Jonas saw on the ring camera.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-did-joe-jonas-see-on-the-ring-camera>What did Joe Jonas see on the ring camera?</h2><p>What did Joe Jonas see on the ring camera? <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported that “multiple sources” said that “Joe had access to a ring cam that he said captured Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over,”&nbsp;so we don’t know exactly what that is—we may never know. According to one source to Us Weekly, Turner said some not-so-nice things about Jonas to a pal. “It wasn’t anything more than that,” the source said, “but that was the final straw.”</p><p>But fans have some interesting and hilarious theories. One Twitter user likened what Turner supposedly did to the hidden camera footage from Meet the Parents, while another took a scene Do Revenge, a comedy starring Turner whose character yells, “I don’t do cocaine, I don’t even know what it looks like.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Meanwhile, on the Reddit subthread, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>What did Joe Jonas catch Sophie Turner doing or saying on their Ring camera? Wrong answers only</a>“, one person wrote: “Got the ring camera footage right here,” and used a scene from Game of Thrones, where the nightmarish King Joffrey kissed Sansa, easily Turner’s most famous role. Another suggested: “She said Frankie was her favorite Jonas,” while one more thought she was caught “Stealing the neighbors’ Hello Fresh deliveries.” It’s fun to theorize.</p><p>As for why they split, some sources, quoted by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>MailOnline</a>, have said that Turner felt robbed of her young adulthood by marrying Jonas at 23 and spending her teen years on&nbsp;Game of Thrones.</p><p>The friend revealed: “Sophie feels like she’s only just waking up to what her life and reality really is. She became famous at a very young age, then married and had kids at a young age and never really had the teenage years of sleeping around and just having carefree fun with friends.”</p><p>The source continued: “She feels like her life has stalled after&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and so has her personal life. Since the kids came along, she’s feeling trapped. She’s the only person in her tight friendship group who is married with two children. Now she feels that she wants to make up for the time she’s lost as a young person. He (Joe) wants a more settled life but she’s not ready for that because she feels that she’s not even had a teen or young adult life.”</p><p>The friend also said that family priorities were a point of contention between the couple: “Joe would like another kid, he’s a real family man. But while Sophie’s been in the UK, she’s also realized just how much she misses this country; it’s the final nail in the coffin for them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-sophie.png><p>Jonas and Turner’s divorce documents, obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>&nbsp;revealed, “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,” with sources explaining that the split did not come as a “surprise” to those who were close to the couple. “They were not separated but they’ve been living separate lives for months,” the source said. “As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real-time. They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the UK.”</p><p>In a joint statement issued to Instagram, the couple explained: “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children,” they said.</p><p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>—the site first to break the news—Jonas filed the paperwork to end his marriage on September 5, 2023, hiring attorney Tom Sasser, who handled Tiger Woods’ divorce. Jonas would be asking for joint custody of the couple’s two children, Willa born in 2020 and their other daughter, born in 2022, whose name has not been made public.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">For more celebrity breakups…</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/List-Redirect-Design.png><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
