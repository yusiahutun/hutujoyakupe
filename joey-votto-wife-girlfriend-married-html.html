Unfortunately, the MLB player got evicted from his game in the first inning (2021).&nbsp;</p><p>Another Cincinnati Reds Fame:&nbsp;</p><p>On a series of unfortunate events on the field, Votto lost his cool and was enraged at&nbsp;Additon, the umpire of the game.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Votto struck out a check-swing after an appeal to the third-base umpire Chirs Guccione. However, he had few words for the third-base umpire while he was headed out of the field.</p><p>But upon hearing umpire Ryan Additon's words exchange for him, he got upset and was thrown out of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Although some people were pleased to lose a threat from the game, not everyone was on the same page.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A particular fan was present to watch the game just for the Canadian player, but her hopes of watching him&nbsp;play&nbsp;were shattered after he got evicted.&nbsp;</p><p>Her mother shared the little fan's teary picture on her Instagram, which soon blew up and reached the player.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Upon seeing the picture, Joey could not&nbsp;keep it to himself and decided to send a little note to the beautiful girl.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Votto signed on&nbsp;a baseball&nbsp;and apologized to the little girl for not completing the game.

He was selected in the second round with the 44th overall selection of the 2002 MLB draft.&nbsp;</p><p>He played for the Reds rookie level for 5 years, then ascended to the major league on 2007.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>During the first year of his major league career, he finished the season with four home runs and 17 RBI.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-638 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This was a splendid achievement for a rookie player that had just been promoted.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2011, he had signed a $38 million deal with the Reds, giving best performances each season.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the same year the MLB star won his first Gold Glove Award,&nbsp;and hit is 100th career home run. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-639 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On 2012, he signed a whopping $225 million contract extension with the Reds for 10 more years. He is still bound by the contract as of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The deal is the 13th largest deal in MLB history.&nbsp;</p><p>The 37-year-old player has had a good run of his career, and he is still going strong.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-640 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Canadian Sports Star recently hit ish 2000th career hit on August 16th while playing against Chicago Cubs.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqOmnrFdq7y1wM5mrqKelWK0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeq6t0augnpxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html&text=Insight%20Into%20Joey%20Votto%27s%20Low-Key%20Love%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html&title=Insight%20Into%20Joey%20Votto%27s%20Low-Key%20Love%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html&title=Insight%20Into%20Joey%20Votto%27s%20Low-Key%20Love%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html&title=Insight%20Into%20Joey%20Votto%27s%20Low-Key%20Love%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoey-votto-wife-girlfriend-married-html.html&description=Insight%20Into%20Joey%20Votto%27s%20Low-Key%20Love%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kelly-clarkson-wows-lace-cut-out-bodysuit-daring-new-look.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelly Clarkson is a vision in daring cut-out lace bodysuit ahead of exciting announcement">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christina-aguilera-sequin-sheer-bodysuit-pride.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Aguilera Takes the Stage in a Sequined Sheer Bodysuit for Pride">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
