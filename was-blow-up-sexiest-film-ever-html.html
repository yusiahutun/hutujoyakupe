It also made an instant star of the then 24-year-old David Hemmings, playing the photographer, and stamped the gamine young Jane Birkin indelibly on the public imagination.</p><p><strong>Scroll down for more</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_03/027BlowUpcopy_468x474.jpg height=474 width=468 alt="the blow up" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Birkin threw off all her clothes, allowing everyone a peek at her pubic hair - the first time this had ever happened in mainstream British cinema.</p><p>Even the lanky young Vanessa Redgrave stripped to the waist in the service of art, and all the young girls in the film were instructed not to wear underwear beneath their mini skirts because it would get in the way of the action.</p><p>As for the film's poster, featuring a tousled Hemmings wielding his lens astride an abandoned Veruschka, the top supermodel of the time, it is a masterpiece of erotica.</p><p>With all these memorable images, Blow-Up became the symbol of Sixties depravity. Yet this most British of films was directed by an Italian - the marvellously named Michelangelo Antonioni, who has just died at the venerable age of 94.</p><p>Already a cult director with his 1960 film L'Avventura, starring his stunning blonde muse Monica Vitti, Antonioni's favourite theme of alienation made him a spokesman of pre-Sixties malaise among the intellectual set. He was so fashionable in art cinemas that in 1964 he was headhunted to make the first of a series of English language films.</p><p>Antonioni already had a germ of an idea from a short story by an Argentinian writer about a photographer who records a Paris seduction scene for the delectation of a voyeur.</p><p>But it was not until he set eyes on the wasteland of South-East London, where he stopped for a pint at the famous White Horse pub in Woolwich, that the film Blow-Up was born. Here, all around, was the changing landscape he needed to demonstrate the restlessness of the Sixties.</p><p>A $1.5million budget was rustled together by the Italian film producer Carlo Ponti, husband of the nubile Sophia Loren, and Antonioni was all set to shoot.</p><p>Perhaps the very fact that he was not British helped Antonioni cast a fresh eye on the phenomenon of Swinging London, capturing so well the footloose spirit of those extraordinary times.</p><p>The director lovingly lingered on such phenomena of the period as new tower blocks being built in the East End; on run- down Notting Hill, which was just becoming trendy; on the Minis and Rolls-Royces of the street scenes; and on the mayhem in a typical nightclub where the Yardbirds are playing and (essential behaviour in those rebellious times) ultimately smash up their guitars.</p><p>In London, he found a new sort of hero - the fashion photographer who typified the excesses of the era.</p><p>Before the Sixties, British photographers were camp and genteel, a la Cecil Beaton. But the emergent hero of the liberal decade was a working-class snapper who was also aggressively heterosexual.</p><p>Antonioni studied three of the best-known London-based advocates of their trade, David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, visiting their studios and examining all the details of their selfindulgent lifestyle, which included always having an assistant on hand to put the film in the Hasselblad camera, while opening yet another bottle of red wine.</p><p>He finally came up with his amalgam - the narcissistic Thomas in white jeans, frilled shirt and velvet jacket.</p><p>Thomas, who closely reflects the London of the time, seems more like Bailey than anyone else. Eastender Bailey famously bedded most of his models, including Marie Helvin and Jean Shrimpton, and even married two of them:</p><p>Catherine Deneuve and his current wife, another Catherine.</p><p>The script of Blow-Up called for Thomas, played by Hemmings, to indulge in the same sort of erotic activity with Sarah Miles, Veruschka and, of course, Birkin, all playing young models who were always hanging around his studio waiting to be discovered.</p><p>Just as the real Sixties photographers did, Thomas becomes a wealthy man through this onerous work; yet already jaded, he is looking for other fish to fry. That's how he finds himself wandering in London's Maryon Park near the Woolwich ferry.</p><p>With his Nikon ever at the ready, he prances through the park to the sound of rustling leaves and plays a game of mock tennis on the park's courts, watched by an excitable group of students dressed in harlequin outfits who drive by in a Land Rover.</p><p>At a loose end, he buys an aircraft propeller for his studio from a local antique shop. Then he starts idly photographing a couple apparently courting in the bushes.</p><p>The intrusion of the camera is so obvious that Vanessa Redgrave, playing one half of the couple, follows Hemmings to his studio and pleads for the negatives back, using blatant sexual ploys to try to convince him.</p><p>Hemmings palms her off with a fake set of photos.</p><p>But his interest has been aroused, and when he develops the film in his darkroom, the image slowly coming into focus through the developing fluid is not of a seduction but of a murder. He goes back in search of the body to the park, where he does indeed find a corpse.</p><p>On his return to the studio, however, he discovers his pictures have disappeared. A second visit to the park reveals the body has also vanished. This poses the question: has any of this happened at all?</p><p>That is all there is to the plot, but with its real-life locations and bold camerawork, the film became a smash hit, netting a staggering $20 million within two years despite its cryptic nature.</p><p>Apart from Maryon Park, a former chalk and gravel pit (where, incidentally, the real foliage was not colourful enough for Antonioni, who painted the grass greener and the trees browner), Hemmings's studio was located in real-life Pottery Lane in Notting Hill, the actual workplace of another famous photographer, John Cowan, who shot many Vogue covers and acted as adviser to Antonioni.</p><p>The director's personal style also added to the interest. Every day, he would turn up in a white Rolls-Royce and wearing a smart Italian suit. Every lunchtime, a hamper and a bottle of champagne would be delivered from Fortnum & Mason in Piccadilly.</p><p>It was all so memorable that a plaque has been put up in the East End to commemorate it as a Sixties location on a par with Carnaby Street. Indeed, some of the locals still walk around dressed as the trendy David Hemmings.</p><p>Yet for many viewers, and indeed the actors and actresses in it, the film remains totally baffling. Sarah Miles was never a fan of the finished product, which she described as a cluster of cliches bundled up in the emperor's new clothes.</p><p>But the cheeky Hemmings, who was perfect for the part, greatly added to the continuing enjoyment of the film by describing the high points of its making in an autobiography completed just before his own death four years ago.</p><p>The erotic nature of his romping with the young Birkin against the photographic paper backdrop was much diminished, Hemmings mischievously recalled, by Antonioni's habit of screaming instructions via an interpreter at the critical moment.</p><p>"Get her knickers off now," yelled the assistant - not to mention the order: "Move! I can't see her t*ts."</p><p>Given the nudity, plus a colourful amble through the empty-headed world of fashion and the mindaltering psychedelia of the times, it was perhaps a sure-fire formula, notwithstanding the mystery of the plot with no solution.</p><p>Even so, Antonioni was surprised when Blow-Up became a success. His subsequent acclaim led him to go to America to make his next couple of films, Zabriskie Point and The Passenger with Jack Nicholson.</p><p>They both looked marvellous, but he never again put his finger on the pulse of the time and place as he did in his London debut.</p><p>Having made his name, he retired to Rome, where, after a crippling stroke which forced him to give up film-making for painting, admirers still beat a path to his door because of Blow-Up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboCWa2lsaV%2BMrrR5oaWmsGWFpXq0sdeinKysXZu2rbmMnq2eql6dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html&text=Was%20Blow-Up%20the%20sexiest%20film%20ever%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html&title=Was%20Blow-Up%20the%20sexiest%20film%20ever%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html&title=Was%20Blow-Up%20the%20sexiest%20film%20ever%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html&title=Was%20Blow-Up%20the%20sexiest%20film%20ever%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-blow-up-sexiest-film-ever-html.html&description=Was%20Blow-Up%20the%20sexiest%20film%20ever%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-balionis-bio-net-worth-age-married-wiki-boyfriend-feet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Balionis Bio, Age, Dad, Net Worth, Married">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./united-way-of-martin-county-reception.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="United Way of Martin County Reception">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
