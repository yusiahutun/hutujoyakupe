The show has since aired for 26 seasons and produced several spinoffs including <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bachelorette</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, Bachelor Pad, The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart and The Bachelor Winter Games.&nbsp;The Bachelor franchise is a reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> dating competition that sees dozens of contestants compete for one single Bachelor or Bachelorette. Each week, the Bachelor or Bachelorette goes on dates with contestants—either one-on-one or in groups—and decides which contestants give roses to (which allows them to move onto next week) and which to eliminate.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The Bachelor and <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-bachelorette data-tag=the-bachelorette>The Bachelorette</a> follow this format until the final Rose Ceremony with the final two contestants, where the lead chooses one contestant to give their Final Rose to and one to send home. The Final Rose Ceremony also often sees the Bachelor propose to his winner or The Bachelorette winner propose to the Bachelorette. A special titled “After the Final Rose” also airs during the finale, which sees the Bachelor or Bachelorette recap their season and update viewers on their relationship with their winner.</p><p>Since the franchise’s premiere in 2002, The Bachelor&nbsp;and The Bachelorette have seen dozens of leads and contestants find love with each other. The franchise has also seen dozens of breakups, which brings us back to The Bachelor engagement rings, who pays for them and what happens to them when a couple breaks up. So what happens to<a href=# rel=noopener> The Bachelor engagement rings</a>? Read on for what we know about how much The Bachelor engagement rings cost and the rules couples have to follow to keep their six-figure piece of jewelry.</p><h2>Who pays for The Bachelor engagement rings?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Deanna-Pappas-The-Bachelorette.jpeg><p>Who pays for the engagement rings on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise? Since The Bachelor season 1 in 2002, engagement rings on The Bachelor franchise have been designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jewelry designer, who has also designed engagement rings for stars like Jessica Simpson and Ellen DeGeneres, as well as jewelry for names like Renée Zellweger, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Hudson. But who pays for The Bachelor engagement rings? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cheat Sheet</a>, Neil Lane donates the engagement rings to The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise in exchange for promotion on the show, which is often seen in scenes where he takes the men engagement ring shopping and other appearances throughout the finale.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">InStyle</a>, Lane explained that he starts the engagement ring design process before he even meets the men but doesn’t finish the design until their consultation in the finale. “I actually start the design process long before I meet the groom,” he said. “The groom and I spend a lot of time together while he’s selecting the ring. We collaborate and through our dialogue, he reveals the characteristics that make his bride and the relationship he has with her unique. With these concepts in mind, I help guide him to the ring that is the true embodiment of his love for her.” Along with engagement rings, Lane also confirmed to InStyle that he’s designed other jewelry for Bachelor Nation couples, such as for when season 17 Bachelor Sean Lowe and his winner Catherine Giudici welcomed their first child in 2016, though it’s unclear if Sean and Catherine paid Lane or if he designed the piece for free. “I made a diamond band for Catherine and Sean Lowe to celebrate the birth of their first child,” Lane told InStyle. “They are such lovely people, and it has been an uplifting experience for me share in their joy and journey.”</p><p>While engagement rings on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise are free if designed by Neil Lane, contestants have to pay for their own engagement rings if they decide to go with a different designer. Among the Bachelor Nation alums who paid for their own rings are season 1 Bachelorette Trista Rehn and her winner Ryan Sutter, as well as season 2 Bachelor Aaron Buerge and his winner, Helene Eksterowicz. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, Aaron paid more than $32,000 for an engagement ring designed by Harry Winston when he proposed to Helene in The Bachelor season 2 finale. After Harry and Helen split weeks after the finale—he broke up with her at a Starbucks—Helene sold the ring on eBay for $28,300.</p><h2>What are The Bachelor engagement ring rules?</h2><p>What are the rules for engagement rings from The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise? Former host Chris Harrison confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2016 that Bachelor Nation couples must stay together for at least two years after their finale airs to keep their engagement rings. If they break up before that time ends, they have to return the engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” Harrison said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>The Bachelorette season 4 winner Jesse Csincsak, who got engaged to Bachelorette DeAnna Pappas, confirmed the rule to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bustle</a> in 2014. “In the contract, it says if you are not together for two years after the final day of the show airing, you have to give them the ring back,” he said. Season 14 Bachelorette Becca Kufrin—who got engaged to her winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, but broke up two years after their finale—joked on the “Bachelor Party” podcast in 2019 that there’s a “graveyard” for all the engagement rings from broken-up Bachelor Nation couples. Becca also got engaged to Arie Luyendyk Jr. on The Bachelor season 22 but broke up before their finale aired. “I will say there is a ring graveyard. They get to keep them all locked away, hidden from everyone—all the scorned rings,” she said.</p><p>As for Lane, he told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where engagement rings from The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise go if the couple breaks up but that he always designs his ring with the hope that the contestants stay together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><h2>How much do The Bachelor engagement rings cost?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hannah-Brown-Jed-Wyatt-The-Bachelorette.jpeg><p>How much do engagement rings from The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise cost?
