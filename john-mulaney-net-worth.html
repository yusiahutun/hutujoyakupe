A former Comedy Central and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> staff writer, <a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney’s net worth</a> and fame skyrocketed after the release of his first two <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> specials: 2015’s <i>The Comeback Kid</i> and 2018’s <i>Kid Gorgeous</i>. He repeated that success with the release of his third Netflix special, <i>John Mulaney: Baby J.</i>, in 2023.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney</a> was born on August 26, 1982 in Chicago, Illinois, and spent the majority of his youth perfecting his improv and joke writing skills. Mulaney attended Georgetown where he majored in English before moving to New York City in 2004 to pursue a career in comedy. He spent much of his early career working for big name comedy institutions like Comedy Central and <i>Saturday Night Live</i>; and found moderate success as a writer and comedian. But it wasn’t until he scored his first hour-long comedy special with Netflix in 2015 that John Mulaney became a household name.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Curious how <a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney’s net worth</a> compares to other comedy legends?

John Mulaney’s net worth is estimated to be around $10 million, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>. </span><span class=s1>Mulaney’s star began to rise after he joined the writing staff of <i>Saturday Night Live </i>in 2008, where he received several Emmy Award nominations and his first Emmy win for co-writing the <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Justin Timberlake monologue</span></a> with Seth Meyers and Justin Timberlake. During his four season run on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, Mulaney helped create iconic characters like Bill Hader’s recurring Weekend Update character “Stefon,” among others. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>, first-year cast members and writers earn around $7,000 per episode, which averages around $147,000 for a typical 21-episode season.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>During his time working as a writer on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, Mulaney released a stand-up comedy album called <i>The Top Part</i> and a stand-up comedy special titled <i>New in Town</i>, which premiered on Comedy Central in 2023 and is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp; And he’s since returned to host <i>Saturday Night Live</i> five times, making him an official member of<i> Saturday Night Live’s</i> coveted Five Timers Club.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After leaving <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, Mulaney went on to write for a variety of television shows, including <i>Important Things with Demetri Martin</i>, <i>Documentary Now!</i> with <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night Live</i> alum Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Seth Meyers; <i>Oh, Hello on Broadway</i> with fellow comedian and Georgetown University alum Nick Kroll; and the <i>Comedy Central Roast of James Franco</i>.

And his newest comedy special <i>John Mulaney: Baby J.</i> premiered on Netflix in 2023.</span></p><h2 class=p3><span class=s1>How much does John Mulaney make from his comedy shows?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Mulaney-Kid-Gorgeous-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>How much money does <a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney</a> make from his comedy shows? Like most popular comedians, a good deal of John Mulaney’s net worth can be attributed to the revenue he makes from his live comedy show tours. According to a 2021 report by <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Pollstar</span></a>, John Mulaney makes an average of $119,645 per show while he’s on tour. And while most comedians are reported to earn anywhere from $3 million to 10 million per special from Netflix, according to a 2017 report by <a href=#><span class=s2><i>Variety</i></span></a>, the financial details surrounding Mulaney’s multi-special deal with Netflix still remain a mystery.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mulaney has had a long working relationship with Netflix, which is likely why the financial details of his deal with the streaming service are kept private. Although there’s not a lot of information about how much money Netflix had paid John Mulaney over the years; it’s likely that his work with Netflix is his most profitable partnership to date. “I’ve been very, very fortunate that doing specials and making albums has allowed me to do more and more stand-up,” Mulaney told <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>The Ringer</span></a> in 2019. “I did not think that was something you could do.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mulaney partnered with Netflix for <i>Comeback Kid</i> and <i>Kid Gorgeous</i> at Radio City, which won him his second Emmy for his comedy writing. Mulaney has worked as a voice actor on the Netflix animated series <i>Big Mouth</i> since 2017. He also worked with Netflix to create a children’s musical comedy special <i>John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch</i> (2019). His latest special <i>John Mulaney: Baby J.</i> is his first major Netflix special since leaving rehab in 2021.</span></p><h2 class=p3><span class=s1>How much was John Mulaney’s divorce settlement from Anna Marie Tendler?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Mulane-Anna-Marie-Tendler.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>How much did <a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney’s divorce from Anna Marie Tendler</a> cost? Not much is known about how much <a href=# rel=noopener>John Mulaney’s divorce settlement</a> cost or the details of the couple’s division of assets. The two were married in July 2014, and did not have any children together. It’s unclear whether the two had a prenup before <a href=#><span class=s2>Mulaney officially filed for divorce</span></a> in July 2021. The pair kept the financial details of their separation out of the press. However, the details of their marital problems were made very public shortly after their separation.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mulaney’s personal life first became the topic of conversation in December 2020, when he announced he was seeking treatment for alcoholism and cocaine addiction after a decade of sobriety. Following an intervention, Mulaney checked himself into a 60-day program at a rehab facility in Pennsylvania. After completing his out-patient program, Mulaney announced in May 2021 that he and his wife—artist Anna Marie Tendler—were separating after six years of marriage. It was just a few days later that rumors began to circulate that <a href=#><span class=s2>Mulaney and actress Olivia Munn were dating</span></a>. In September of that year, Mulaney and Munn announced that the pair were expecting their first child together.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Upon the announcement of the divorce filing, Mulaney’s team released a statement stating: “John will not have any further comment as he continues to focus on his recovery and getting back to work.” In her own statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Page Six</span></a>, Tendler expressed her sadness and confusion over the split, “I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage. I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery,”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In May 2021, Mulaney made his return to stand up comedy with a limited number of small club performances in New York City with <i>John Mulaney: From Scratch</i>, where he discussed the details of his drug addiction, divorce, and life after rehab. And on September 7, 2021, just a few months after announcing his divorce, Mulaney shared that he and actress Olivia Munn were dating and expecting a child. The two welcomed their first child together, a son <a href=#><span class=s2>Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney</span></a>, on November 24, 2021. In January 2022, Mulaney finalized his divorce to Tendler and has remained mostly out of the public eye since the birth of his son.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Baby J is available to stream on Netflix.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
