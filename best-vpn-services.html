VPNs can serve all kinds of purposes. You can circumvent censorship, <a href=#>access another country's Netflix library</a>, or simply add an extra layer of security while on the internet.</p><p>The very best VPNs can do all of the above, but as with any product, some will <a href=#>do better at one job than others</a>. On top of that, there are other things to consider, like usability, speed, and even the number of servers when looking to buy a VPN.</p><p>Most importantly, though, is the question of privacy and security. As new VPN providers are springing up right and left, it can be hard to figure out which ones are bonafide and which were brought into existence purely to steal your data---and there are <a href=#>plenty of untrustworthy VPNs</a> out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've gone over all our picks below, checking what they can and cannot do, as well as poring over their privacy policies with a fine-toothed comb.

It offers everything you might need from a VPN and then some. It's fast (so it only slows you down slightly) and easy to use. ExpressVPN's interface is pretty much just one big button to switch it on and off, with one other button to access the server menu. Simple, easy, and effective.</p><p>More importantly, ExpressVPN does everything you need a VPN to do. It easily gets past the <a href=#>Netflix VPN block</a>, as well as Amazon Prime and Hulu's blockers. It's also highly secure thanks to advanced encryption, meaning it's a great option for <a href=#>circumventing Chinese censorship</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only real downside is that it's one of the priciest VPNs on the market, costing $116.95 a year. It's a steep price, but ExpressVPN is worth it, especially with the ability to connect up to five devices at the same time. It also comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee to check it out at your leisure.</p><p>ExpressVPN is the go-to VPN for many of the How-To Geek team, and we've never had a problem with it over the years. You can also check out <a href=#>our review of ExpressVPN</a> to get a feel of what you're paying for:</p><p>ExpressVPN gets a lot right with its reassuring no-logs policy, a remote base of operations, solid apps for both desktop and mobile, and performance that (in our testing) meets expectations.</p><p>In short, ExpressVPN is just awesome. It's fast, user-friendly, secure, has a <a href=#>VPN kill switch</a>, and streams everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>ExpressVPN</h5><span>Best Overall VPN</span><p class=display-card-description>ExpressVPN is fast, easy to use, and has no problems accessing Netflix and other streaming services.

As of March 2023, you can get two years for just $2.19 a month (for a total of $56.94), and get two additional months for free, making this VPN a stellar value. PIA sometimes runs other promotions, too.</p><p>But that said, other VPN services also offer some great sales. What sets PIA apart is that a deal stays a deal. Most other providers will offer a great deal, but you have to <a href=#>pay the "real" price</a> upon renewal. PIA confirmed in an email that, if you sign up, you'll pay the same price again upon renewal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Price aside, PIA is a great VPN in general. With access to servers in 84 countries, you can bypass Netflix and other sites' geoblocking to access region-locked content. PIA notes that it has servers in every US state, too. PIA also has great speedsâ€”for more details, you can check out the speed comparisons in our <a href=#>PIA review</a>:</p><p>Besides price, the other thing that has made Private Internet Access stand out over the years are its speeds: they're usually pretty good. When I tested this time around---using <a href=#>speedtest.net</a> ---I wasn't disappointed, though there seem to be some issues with server load on the streaming servers.</p><p>PIA even has some servers that are optimized for streaming, although this is a double-edged sword. During prime times, our testing showed that these streaming services would take a speed hit (presumably from heavy load.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This VPN has the features you expect, including <a href=#>modern protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard</a>, a kill switch, and a no-log policy. There are a few catches: You can't sign up to it anonymously, however, unlike some other VPNs. It's also headquartered in the USA, and <a href=#>we recommend against torrenting using US-based VPNs</a>. Overall, PIA is a really solid VPN and a great value.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Private Internet Access</h5><span>Best Budget VPN</span><p class=display-card-description>Private Internet Access is a great VPN available at a low price---and it stays that way, instead of charging more after a sales period.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">PIA</a><h2 id=best-vpn-for-windows-nordvpn>Best VPN for Windows: <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">NordVPN</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hide-me-logo-small-2.png><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>âœ“ Easy to use</p></td><td><p>âœ— Fluctuating speeds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âœ“ Great Windows app</p></td><td><p>âœ— High renewal price</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a way, picking the best VPN for Windows is like picking the most user-friendly VPN. The operating system is so ubiquitous that the best here is the best everywhere. We've chosen <a href=#>NordVPN</a> for this slot because it's extremely easy to use and does everything well. We go into this more in our <a href=#>NordVPN review</a>:</p><p>Its main strength is its interface, which is an interactive map of the world. Click on a location on the map, and NordVPN will connect you to that location. Easy as pie.</p><p>NordVPN doesn't stand out in any particular way but does everything quite well. Its biggest asset is its user-friendly interface, which offers an interactive world map so you can easily pick VPN servers. We also like how it lays out all its settings, ensuring that even the <a href=#>most novice user</a> can figure out what they're doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to general usability, NordVPN does good. It can be very fast---it strongly depends on the server you pick---and offers decent security and privacy. It also offers some special servers, most of which we suggest you don't use as they don't seem to have much utility. <a href=#>Double VPN</a> servers are a particular annoyance.</p><p>NordVPN is also pretty cheap the first time you sign up, offering a two-year plan for about $100. Renewing this subscription will put you back more than double that, so definitely keep track of your renewal date and decide if you want to pay the increased price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>NordVPN</h5><span>Best VPN for Windows</span><p class=display-card-description>NordVPN is a great all-around VPN that's easy for anyone to set up, making it great for Windows users.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">NordVPN</a><h2 id=best-free-vpn-windscribe>Best Free VPN: <a href=#>Windscribe</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/best-vpns-expressvpn-logo2-5.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>âœ“ Generous free plan</p></td><td><p>âœ— Best features are locked until you pay</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>âœ“ Inexpensive upgrade</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you'd prefer not to pay any money for a VPN, a few decent companies offer free plans. You need to be careful with free VPNs, though, as many "free" VPN companies out there exist <a href=#>purely to steal your data</a> and sell it to advertisers and data miners.</p><p>In fact, the problem is so bad that we recommend using only three VPNs with a free plan: <a href=#>Proton VPN</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">TunnelBear</a>, and <a href=#>Windscribe</a>, with the last being the best of them.</p><p>The main issue of free legitimate VPNs is bandwidth, or the amount of data that can be passed through the VPN. TunnelBear offers only 500MB of free bandwidth per month, upgradeable to 1GB by tweeting about the service.</p><p>Windscribe, on the other hand, offers twenty times as much, 10GB per month and another 5GB by tweeting. Referring friends gets you another 1GB per referral, too. Though 15GB isn't enough to sustain a hardcore torrenting habit, it should be more than enough for most people. You may even be able to use this free bandwidth for Netflix, as we mention in our <a href=#>Windscribe review</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giving your email address mainly seems to mean you'll get the occasional marketing mail, a small price to pay for a free VPN that's actually trustworthy. Interestingly enough, some of its free servers get through to Netflix, meaning that you could <a href=#>unblock Netflix</a> for free with the service. 2GB of bandwidth is roughly two movies worth of viewing, and 10GB is a season binge.</p><p>Proton VPN doesn't have bandwidth caps like Windscribe, but instead limits you to just a handful of servers and also caps your speeds. This makes it a good pick for people that want to secure their browsing but nothing else. However, we feel Windscribe's superior speeds give it an edge here.</p><p>The only reason to use TunnelBear over Windscribe is that the former has servers in a lot more countries available for free users; Windscribe only has 10. We'd take 20 times the bandwidth over country choice any day, so Windscribe gets our recommendation here. Upgrading Windscribe into a paid version costs only $49 per year and works great with Netflix, so that's another upside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the three free VPNs we mentioned, Windscribe offers 10GB of bandwidth, about twenty times more than TunnelBear.

This VPN app is fast, secure, and has made a clear commitment to users' privacy. It also offers a decent pricing scheme and offers a discount if you bundle <a href=#>Proton VPN with ProtonMail</a>, as we mention in <a href=#>our review of Proton VPN</a>:</p><p>Of course, the question of the value of Proton VPN changes a little if you take <a href=# rel="sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Proton Unlimited</a> into account, a plan that bundles Proton VPN, Proton Mail, Proton Drive, and the new-ish Proton Calendar. At $120 per year, it's not quite the <a href=#>Google Drive killer</a> Proton seems to want it to be, but it's still a pretty good deal considering you get some nifty services on top of your VPN.</p><p>That said, the bundle does raise the price from $96 for the VPN alone to $288, so it's not exactly cheap. A tip for readers in eurozone countries, though: Change the pricing display to U.S. dollars. For some reason, Proton VPN maintains the same numbers for the different currencies, meaning you'll pay a fair amount extra if you're looking at prices in your local currency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main reason we like Proton VPN for iPhone is due to its interface.

For gamers, one of the most important things is to have low ping, or <a href=#>latency</a>. In short, this is how fast your internet connection reacts to your actions; in games, it determines how soon you act when you press the button. If your gun is slow to fire when seeing an opponent, you're toast.</p><p>The problem is that VPNs will always slow you down and give you a higher ping. This is because the signals have farther to travel. While there's no way around this, the best you can hope for is to contain the damage. This is where <a href=#>TorGuard</a> comes in---it's a solid VPN that's among the fastest on the market and keeps ping low.</p><p><a href=#>When testing TorGuard</a>, the VPN managed to keep latency at an acceptable level:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Losing only 10% of the connection's speeds when connecting to Japan is a solid result, and we like how overall <a href=#>ping</a> doesn't take too much of a hit, either---TorGuard should be a <a href=#>great VPN for gaming</a> .</p><p>The further you hop from your current location, the worse it will get, of course, but if you keep distances reasonable you should be able to game online and remain competitive.</p><p>TorGuard has plenty going for it besides ping and speeds, too.

Anonymity and speed make a VPN ideal for torrenters, and IVPN offers both.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>IVPN allows you to sign up without using an email address, and you can pay with pseudonymous methods like cryptocurrency or anonymously with cash. This means that even if IVPN is forced to hand over user records, there's nothing there except the number IVPN assigned you. You do need to make sure you don't lose that code, however, as we mention in our <a href=#>IVPN review</a>:</p><p>Your only account information is a code, there's no email or other identifiable information. This keeps things nice and anonymous but comes with the downside that you need to keep the code safe or lose access to your VPN. Since IVPN keeps no record of you other than the code, there's no way to retrieve your account if you lose it.</p><p>Seeing how a few VPNs have been forced to hand user data over, it's nice to know there's nothing IVPN has that will track back to you.</p><p>IVPN is also pretty affordable.

It's a way of sending data across a public network (like the internet) as if you were connected to a private network in a different location. Consumer VPN services are often used to bypass geographical restrictions, avoid internet censorship, and boost privacy. An organization like an employer or school may have you connect to its own VPN to access resources on its network.</p><h3>How Does a VPN Work?</h3><p>When you connect to a VPN, your device creates <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/791382/what-is-a-vpn-tunnel-a-quick-look-at-vpn-security/>a secure tunnel</a> between itself and the remote VPN server. The VPN server functions as a go-between, forwarding traffic back and forth. Anyone in between---for example, your internet service provider, workplace network, or coffee shop Wi-Fi operator---can only see that you're connecting to the VPN server, not what you're connecting to. The server or service you're connecting to sees your <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/341307/how-do-ip-addresses-work/>IP address</a> as the VPN's. For example, if you're in the U.K. and connect to a VPN server in the U.S., you will be able to browse the internet as if you were in the U.S., and websites would see your IP address as being in the U.S.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>How Do I Get the Most Out of a VPN?</h3><p>First, choose a solid VPN. Not all VPNs are equal. For the best service, you'll have to pay for a VPN. The good news is that solid VPNs only cost a few dollars a month. Many free VPNs violate your privacy and collect data to pay their bills. While some paid VPNs do have free plans that are more trustworthy, even their free servers will generally be slower than the paid servers. <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/803837/what-country-should-i-set-my-vpn-to/>For maximum speed, connect to a nearby server</a> (unless you must appear to be in a faraway country.) If you're looking for privacy, <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/717587/does-a-vpn-really-make-your-online-activity-private/>rethink how you browse online</a>.</p><h3>How Do I Set Up a VPN?</h3><p>If you're picking a consumer VPN, setup is easy: You will just need to create an account, download an application, sign in, and press a button or two. The VPNs we recommend offer apps for platforms like Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, iPad, Chrome OS, and Linux. There are also some operating-system level features for connecting to VPNs---you may use these with a workplace or other organization's network---but we recommend using your preferred VPN service's app for ease of setup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Can I Still Use Streaming Platforms on a VPN?</h3><p>It depends on the VPN you choose and the streaming service you're trying to watch. Netflix and other streaming services are playing a game of cat-and-mouse with VPNs, constantly <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/802194/can-you-still-stream-netflix-or-other-services-with-a-vpn/>trying to block VPNs</a> to fulfill content licensing requirements while VPNs are trying to get around the blocks. We recommend choosing a high-quality, highly rated VPN to ensure the best luck with streaming services.</p><h3>Can I Change My IP Location With a VPN?</h3><p>A VPN effectively lets you change your IP address's location. That's because the VPN functions as a middleman, forwarding traffic back and forth. If you're in the U.S. and connect to a VPN in Japan, websites and other services you connect to over the VPN will see your IP address as the IP address of the VPN in Japan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Can I Be Tracked Using a VPN?</h3><p>A VPN can make it more difficult to track you online. Rather than using a unique IP address, you're sharing a VPN's IP address with other people, and that IP address isn't tied to your physical location. There are still many ways you could be tracked: If you don't choose a trustworthy VPN, the VPN itself may track you and sell your data. If you connect to a VPN and promptly sign into Facebook with your normal Facebook account, now Facebook knows who you are---even though you're using a VPN. We recommend <a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/715802/whats-the-difference-between-incognito-mode-and-a-vpn/>using Incognito Mode and VPN together for maximum privacy</a>.</p><h3>Does a VPN Slow Down My Internet Speed?</h3><p>There's no way around it---<a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.howtogeek.com/825785/why-does-a-vpn-slow-down-your-internet-connection/>a VPN will generally slow down your internet speed</a> while you're using it. Rather than connecting directly to websites and other servers, you're adding an additional step in the middle. In some rare cases, a VPN may be faster---if your internet or network service provider is slowing down some types of traffic but not VPN traffic, for example---but you should not expect this. You can choose to use a VPN only for specific applications or only enable it at specific times. If you choose one of the best fast VPNs (like <a href=# data-mce-href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/156932/1330033/16063?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU209487&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2F" class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">ExpressVPN</a>, which we recommend), the slowdown will often be very minimal and perhaps even unnoticeable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>What Are the Red Flags to Look Out for in a VPN?</h3><p>VPNs are big business, and it's important to <a href=#>look out for red flags</a>. If a VPN is completely free for all its users, that's a red flag---the VPN must be making money somewhere to pay its bills, perhaps by tracking its users and selling their data. For paid VPNs, sketchy websites full of typos and a lack of reviews (or fake-looking reviews) are bad signs. You should also ensure you pick a VPN with a <a href=#>no-log policy</a>, although you're trusting the VPN's promises here---unless the VPN submits to an independent audit. The best thing you can do to avoid bad VPNs is to seek out trustworthy, widely recommended VPNs with longstanding good reputations, like the ones we cover in this guide. You may be able to save a bit of money by going with an unknown option, but a good VPN just costs a few bucks a month. You're placing a lot of trust in a VPN, so you don't want to cut corners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhubHBgbH5wrsSsq2auoKN6tLHRr6CcnaNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-vpn-services.html&text=The%20Best%20VPN%20Services%20of%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-vpn-services.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-vpn-services.html&title=The%20Best%20VPN%20Services%20of%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-vpn-services.html&title=The%20Best%20VPN%20Services%20of%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-vpn-services.html&title=The%20Best%20VPN%20Services%20of%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-vpn-services.html&description=The%20Best%20VPN%20Services%20of%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-do-women-tend-to-cross-their-legs-while-men-sit-with-them-open.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why do women tend to cross their legs, while men sit with them open?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mia-mastroianni-and-jon-taffer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mia Mastroianni and Jon Taffer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
