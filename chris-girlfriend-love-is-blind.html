During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or break up as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Variety</a> about how the connections on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ girlfriend from Love Is Blind</a> Season 5. So who is Chris’ girlfriend from Love Is Blind and who did he cheat on Johnie with?

And then the next week I didn’t see him,” Johnie said. “I found out the following weekend that Chris was seeing someone else. I never saw him again.”</p><p>Chris confirmed Johnie’s story. “That is how it went down, and I didn’t handle the situation as someone would properly. But I did someone who I now live with and I love, and we’re very happy together,” he said. “I’m sorry if that hurts to hear, but the whole experience is to find yourself and then findg someone who accepts you for who you are. And that’s what I found and I wouldn’t change that for anything.”</p><p>So who is Chris’ girlfriend from Love Is Blind? Chris’ girlfriend is a woman named Erin Berger. In July 2022, Erin posted an Instagram photo with Chris with the caption: “Appreciation post for my favorite person.

When host Vanessa Lachey asked Chris during the Love Is Blind Season 5 if he thought what he did was cheating, he confirmed that he did. “It’s terrible. I know I was wrong. I felt guilty and heartbroken and as many emotions I could. I did fall in love with you and I still care about you,” Chris told Johnie. “It’s a terrible thing to do, and probably one of my biggest regrets is not being forthcoming with you. I’ve apologized and I continuously apologize.”</p><p>Johnie revealed that she found out Chris cheated on her when her friend saw him with the other woman. “My friend saw him with the other girl and told me. I think I blamed myself still a little,” she said. Chris added, “It’s my fault. You don’t need to.. it’s not you. One of my biggest faults that I continuously try to work through is to tell people news they don’t want to hear, and it sounds good, like I don’t want to say bad things to somebody, but it doesn’t work. It’s not a good trait to have. I continuously, to this day, try to work through that.”</p><p>Johnie added, “I think he thought he didn’t want to hurt me, so he thought maybe he was going to ease his way out.” Chris continued, “There was no plan. It was just I love this girl.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind Season 5 reunion, Johnie confirmed that she and Chris are still in touch after their breakup. “It was weird seeing Chris again. We really haven’t talked at all since I found out about everything that happened,” she said. “But it was nice. I feel like we can be cordial and wish each other the best going forward, and it felt like good closure.”</p><p>Chris added, “My relationship with Johnie today is good friendship with a crazy experience that we shared together. We did try to work things out. It didn’t work. I’m happy now with the relationship I’m in. I’m in love with my girlfriend who I live with.

Since being single, dating apps have left him frustrated, as Chris only matches with women who ‘seem to not be looking for the commitment’&nbsp; he wants in a lifelong partnership.
