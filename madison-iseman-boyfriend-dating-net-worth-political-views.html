Now, Hollywood’s remake machine is ready once again to re-adapt the movies into a TV series with Madison Iseman in the lead.</p><p>So, who is Madison Iseman? Keep reading to find out.</p><h3><strong>Madison Iseman On I Know What You Did Last Summer</strong></h3><p>The original I Know What You Did Last Summer was about a group of young friends who are involved in a car accident and cover it up. A year later, a murderer starts to stalk the kids and harass them.</p><p>The script of the upcoming Amazon Prime TV series has some differences from that of the original. The writer of the show Sara Goodman has introduced a very personal twist to the plot.</p><p>Madison Iseman will play two characters, twins Alison and Lennon. Lennon is wilder and manipulative. She sleeps with the guy her sister loves and makes an OnlyFans account under his sister’s name. Alison is much straighter. However, while Alison is driving a car in the dark, she accidentally hits her Lennon.</p><p>From then on, the plot is similar to the old script. The friends dump Lennon’s body on the water. And a year later, a murderer starts to terrorize the town to make people face the consequences.</p><p>Apart from Madison, the show will feature Brianne Tju, Ezekiel Goodman, Ashley Moore, <a href=#>Sebastian Amoruso</a>, Fiona Rene, Bill Heck, Cassie Beck, Brooke Bloom, etc. in the major roles.</p><p>About the challenge of playing two characters in a single film, Madison said, “It’s on every actor’s bucket list, I feel like, to play twins…It was a challenge, but it was one I was up for.”</p><h3><strong>Does Madison Iseman Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Of course, Madison Iseman has a boyfriend. She is currently dating a musician and X-Factor participant Spencer Sutherland. Spencer is a singer/songwriter from Ohio, who has a string of singles released between 2013 and 2019</p><p>Reports have it that Madison and her boyfriend, Spencer started dating sometime in October 2015.&nbsp; Spencer was a constant feature on Madison’s social media, Twitter and Instagram. Especially on Instagram, there are photos of them kissing, or on a date, or just handing out together.</p><p>Lately, however, there has been a break in the steady supply of boyfriend pictures on Madison’s Instagram. The last photo of the two of them together was posted on 30 March 2020. And the post said: “<span>I love you and I’m so grateful I get to be stuck in quarantine with you. I miss going to coffee shops with you, but that’s okay because we can just make espresso at home… “</span></p><p>But Madison has not removed the previous posts from her social media. Therefore, most likely, they are still together.</p><h3><strong>Madison Iseman Dating History</strong></h3><p>Before Spencer, Madison Iseman was dating a Youtuber called Jack Dodge. And when they were dating they used to post videos together. There were also some Tweets on both Jack’s and Madison’s Twitter, mentioning the relationship between them.</p><p>Unfortunately, that relationship did not last more than a few months.</p><h3><strong>Madison Iseman Political Views</strong></h3><p>We do not have much info about Madison’s political views. However, some Tweets criticized Madison’s stance on Identity Politics and the way she had contributed to the over-sexualization of women in Hollywood. The latter had to do with some of the raunchy dresses that Madison had appeared in over the years.</p><h3><strong>Madison Iseman Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Madison Iseman made her acting debut in a 2013 movie called Second Chances. In 2016, she appeared as Charlotte in Still the King, a comedy series, which was not only her first big break but also her most well-known role.</p><p>In 2017, Madison also played the character of Bethany on Jumani: Welcome to the Jungle. Her other minor film credits are Despair Sessions (2015), Ghost Squad (2015), Annabelle Comes Home (2019), Jumani: The Next Level (2019), Fear of Rain (2021), etc.</p><p>Madison also had performances in TV shows like Henry Danger (2015), The Social Experiment (2015), the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer (2021), etc. Her latest film Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac is in the filming stage and will be released in 2023.</p><p>By October 2021, Madison Iseman had earned a net worth of over $500 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Madison Iseman?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Born on Valentine’s day (14 February) 1997, Madison was 24 years of age.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Madison Iseman?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Madison is 5 feet 2 inches tall.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Are Madison Iseman’s Parents, Siblings?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Madison’s father was John Iseman.
