The seven castaways were played by Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr, Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Tina Louise, <a href=#>Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson</a>. All the actors had fantastic chemistry, which translated onscreen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>It would take exactly 30 years for the actress to land her most famous role as Ginger Grant on Gilligan's Island. Here are 11 early photos of Tina Louise!<a href=#>https://t.co/ITxY8lqwdo</a></p>— MeTV (@MeTV) <a href=#>August 16, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-3_63>Sadly, Tina Louise is the last surviving cast member of the series. Lousie was born on Feb. 11, 1934, and like her sitcom character, was a movie star. She worked as a model and theatre actor before making her film debut in the 1958 classic God’s Little Acre. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDB.com</a>, she won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer for the film.</p><p id=par-4_12>But her role as Ginger Grant would make her a household name.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-the-cast-of-gilligan-s-island-now>Where is the cast of ‘Gilligan’s Island’ now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gilligans-Island-Tina-Louise.jpg><p id=par-5_51>Louise’s fear of being <a href=#>typecast came true with her Gilligan’s Island role</a>. She never could shake the Ginger Grant image, which is why she skipped reprising the role for the film’s sequels. However, she would reunite with her castmates for reunion specials on Good Morning America, The Late Show, and Roseanne.</p><p id=par-6_69>After the show’s cancellation, Lousie landed minor roles in films such as The Stepford Wives and TV shows like Dallas and Married…With Children. Aside from acting, Louise is also an author with three published works, including the children’s book When I Grow Up. As for Louise’s personal life, she has a daughter named Caprice Caine with TV announcer Les Crane, whom she was married to from 1966 to 1971.</p><h2 id=h-gilligan-s-island-cast-death-dates>‘Gilligan’s Island’ cast death dates</h2><p id=par-7_55>Backus was the first Gilligan’s Island cast member to die. The actor died on Jul. 3, 1989, from pneumonia and Parkinson’s disease. <a href=#>Aside from Thurston Howell</a>, Backus was famous for voicing the cartoon character Mr. Magoo. Backus was survived by his second wife, Henny Backus, who guest-starred as a tribe native on the CBS sitcom.</p><p id=par-8_63>Nearly two years after Backus’ death, his onscreen wife Schafer died from liver cancer on Apr. 10, 1991. Schafer was secretive about her age and didn’t even tell her co-stars. It wasn’t until her death that her actual age, 90, was revealed in her obituary. Like her character Mrs. Howell, Schafer was rich, and according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, was worth $10 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-9_54>Hale, who played the burly, but lovable Skipper, died from thymus cancer on Jan. 2, 1990. Aside from acting, Hale ventured into the restaurant business by opening The Lobster Barrell in the 1970s. Hale was survived by his second wife, Naomi Grace Ingram, and his four children from his first marriage to Bettina Doerr.</p><p id=par-10_52>Denver, who played <a href=#>the main character, clumsy first mate Gilligan</a> died from pneumonia and throat cancer on Sept. 2, 2005. Aside from Gilligan’s Island, he was also known for his work on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Denver was survived by his fourth wife, Dreama Perry, two sons, and two daughters.</p><p id=par-11_53>Johnson, who played The Professor, died from kidney failure on Jan. 16, 2014, at 89. He was survived by his third wife, Constance Dane, his daughter Kim Johnson, and his stepson Courtney Dane. Johnson’s son David died from AIDS in Oct. 1994, and the actor dedicated his time to working with AIDS charities.</p><p id=par-12_61>Wells, who played farm girl Mary Ann Summers, died on Dec. 30, 2020, from COVID-19-related complications. She had no children, and her only marriage was to talent agent Larry Rosen from 1962 to 1967. Despite her work on the classic TV show and her other work, <a href=#>Wells experienced financial issues</a>. Her net worth at the time of her death was $50,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwor%2FTZp6ipJyetKK60magrKSRo7Fuus6wZaGsnaF8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html&text=Where%20Is%20the%20Cast%20of%20%27Gilligan%27s%20Island%27%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html&title=Where%20Is%20the%20Cast%20of%20%27Gilligan%27s%20Island%27%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html&title=Where%20Is%20the%20Cast%20of%20%27Gilligan%27s%20Island%27%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html&title=Where%20Is%20the%20Cast%20of%20%27Gilligan%27s%20Island%27%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcast-gilligans-island-now-html.html&description=Where%20Is%20the%20Cast%20of%20%27Gilligan%27s%20Island%27%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./woman-arrested-for-assault-in-clinton-stabbing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman arrested for assault in Clinton stabbing">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./video-sienna-miller-opts-flapper-style-dress-2023-met-gala-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Video: Sienna Miller opts for flapper style dress at the 2023 Met Gala">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
