Where is she now, and what is her story?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Drug trafficking is one of the most common crimes in the world. Millions of people deal drugs daily, and this “business” has bred some drug lords who have become very famous over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the infamous Pablo Escobar, Frank Lucas was a nefarious drug dealer. His wife, Julianna Farrait, was his rock through all his illegal dealings. Here’s her story.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Julianna_Farrait_Rodriguezs_Bio></span>Julianna Farrait Rodriguez’s Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juliana Farrait Rodriguez, also known as Julie Farrait, is the famous wife of the renowned drug lord Frank Lucas. She was born in 1941 in Puerto Rico to very wealthy parents. Her parents were reportedly one of the richest in the area she grew up in, and she was pretty popular for that.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/369012981_6429861007127658_551303251696153899_n.jpg><p>Farrait had her early education in Puerto Rico for obvious reasons. Before graduating, she attended an unknown high school where she was the Homecoming queen. Details about her further education are unknown, and it is unclear if she furthered her education.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frank_Lucas_and_Julianna_Farraits_Relationship></span>Frank Lucas and Julianna Farrait’s Relationship&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frank Lucas met Julianna Farrait when the latter just returned to Puerto Rico from a trip. They fell in love almost instantaneously and began dating shortly afterward.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people speak highly of their relationship even though they were both involved in illegal activities. They were visibly in love and showed their affection for each other openly and publicly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They were also known for giving each other the most extravagant gifts, thanks to the millions they got from their drug business. The lovebirds often exchanged multimillion-dollar items such as customized suits, trips, and luxury cars.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/284697494_3291906537751492_3358716417394510610_n.jpg><p>From Farrait’s pictures, one can easily tell that she was used to the lavish lifestyle and was not shy about it. Farrait and her husband were tagged the “Black Bonnie and Clyde” because of their close relationship and illegal activities.</p><p>Also, Julianna Farrait was prosecuted several times because of the couple’s run-ins with the law but never snitched on her husband.&nbsp;She stood by him through all his court proceedings and indictments and did not mind when she was caught in the crossfire several times.</p><p>The drug lord’s wife was in and out of jail several times on drug-related charges and was once incarcerated for attempting to sell cocaine to a government informant in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;They were married for over 40 years until Lucas passed away.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frank_Lucas_and_Julianna_Farraits_Children></span>Frank Lucas and Julianna Farrait’s Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The famous love birds had seven children throughout their 40-year-long marriage. They are Francineucas-Sinclair, Frank Lucas Jr., Ray Lucas, Betty Lucas, Candace Lucas, Ruby Lucas, and Tony Walters.&nbsp;</p><p>Three of their children were biological, while four were stepchildren.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frank_Lucas_and_Julianna_Farraits_Net_Worth></span>Frank Lucas and Julianna Farrait’s Net Worth&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple handled their multimillion-dollar drug business together with trust and utmost dedication. Their cartel was highly successful during its prime and built an empire. They earned an estimated $64 million from their drug deals, enabling them to live the most lavish lifestyle without worrying about funds.</p><p>However, most of this wealth is gone now. As of 2021, Frank Lucas’ wife has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million, which is shocking compared to what they used to own.&nbsp;How exactly the couple lost all their wealth is not confirmed, but speculators have their theories about the family’s downfall.</p><p>Some believe the couple spent most of their wealth on legal bills, as they were both in and out of jail regularly.&nbsp;Others believe that the Puerto Rican government seized and liquidated most of their assets bit by bit after their multiple slip-ups and jail times.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Julianna_Farrait_Now></span>Where Is Julianna Farrait Now?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Julianna Farrait</a> currently resides in Teaneck, New Jersey. She keeps out of the public eye and is reportedly happier for it. She lives with some of her kids, raising them and being present for them as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Farrait is 82 years old as of 2023 and rarely seen in public or populated areas.&nbsp;</p><p>Like with Bonnie and Clyde, Lucas and Farrait’s story has been adapted into a biographical film. In 2007, her life with her husband and their drug dealings were put into a film named “American Gangster.” The movie featured some of Hollywood’s biggest stars who played various characters in the adaptation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/263062822_4522794934483500_6820214422608871257_n.jpg><p>Legendary actor <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a> played Frank Lucas, while Lymari Nadal Torres played Julianna Farrait under a different name. Other notable stars in the biopic included Chiwetel Ejiofor, RZA, and Russell Crowe.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Frank Lucas is late now, Julianna still cherishes his memory as her one true love and refuses to get remarried till she goes six feet under.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt7a4yJqlp5ldm66zvsCiq2asmJp6tMDOq7Bmp5Zis7OtzaRkpa2TlsBuw8ifnGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html&text=Julianna%20Farrait%3a%20The%20Story%20of%20Frank%20Lucas%27%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html&title=Julianna%20Farrait%3a%20The%20Story%20of%20Frank%20Lucas%27%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html&title=Julianna%20Farrait%3a%20The%20Story%20of%20Frank%20Lucas%27%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html&title=Julianna%20Farrait%3a%20The%20Story%20of%20Frank%20Lucas%27%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjulianna-farrait-the-story-of-frank-lucas-wife.html&description=Julianna%20Farrait%3a%20The%20Story%20of%20Frank%20Lucas%27%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nickelbacks-chad-kroeger-sued.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nickelback's Chad Kroeger Sued">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./atomic-coffee-temporarily-loses-their-energy-drink.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Atomic Coffee temporarily loses their energy (drink)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
