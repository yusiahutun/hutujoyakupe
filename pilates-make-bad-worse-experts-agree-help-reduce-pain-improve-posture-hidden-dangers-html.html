I didn’t think to question it.’</span><br></p><p><span>But within a few weeks the numbness worsened and Sophie had excruciating pain at the base of her spine.

The problem is how Pilates is being&nbsp;taught.</span><br></p><p><span>‘I’m seeing an increasing number of patients who have muscular strains or aggravated degenerate discs after attending Pilates classes because they thought it would help with their back problems,’ says Stewart Tucker, an orthopaedic and spinal surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>‘While I recommend it for back pain and after injury, if exercises are carried out incorrectly they can weaken the back and cause existing conditions to deteriorate.’</span><br></p><p><span>Pilates, practised by an estimated one million Britons, was devised 80 years ago by Joseph Pilates, a German sportsman, to improve muscle&nbsp;strength.</span><br></p><p><span>He did this by working on the deep abdominal muscles; one of the main exercises involves drawing in the tummy to the spine and lifting the pelvic floor.</span><br></p><p><span>‘In layman’s terms, focusing on this area strengthens the muscles from within — giving the back an internal brace, so to speak, which can be helpful for degenerate disc disease or rehabilitation from any back surgery,’ says Mr&nbsp;Tucker.</span><br></p><p><span>However, when it isn’t tailored to an individual or taught correctly according to the patient’s back diagnosis, problems can occur.</span><br></p><p><span>‘With the celebrity endorsement of Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Pippa Middleton, Pilates is a popular way of keeping toned and slim with good posture,’ says Priya Dasoju of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.</span><br></p><p><span>‘But its popularity means it’s sometimes looked at as nothing more than a gym class, which isn’t necessarily good for those with back problems.</span><br></p><p><span>‘Traditional Pilates incorporates exercises that&nbsp;can be challenging — particularly if you have an existing back problem.<br></span></p><p><span>'Indeed, even if you carry them out correctly, they can put excess strain on the spine and surrounding muscles.</span><br></p><p><span>‘Classes of more than 12 people don’t help. There’s no way the teacher can keep a close eye on every person’s moves, and a student won’t know whether they are doing an exercise correctly, which can lead to problems.’</span><br></p><p><span>Unfortunately, this puts the 80 per cent of Britons who suffer from back pain at some time in their&nbsp;lives in a Catch-22 situation: their orthopaedic surgeons, doctors and physiotherapists may recommend Pilates, but not all classes on offer will be beneficial.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/19/article-2161301-131F640F000005DC-272_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="Check if your teacher has an appropriate qualification, such as one from the Pilates Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Check if your teacher has an appropriate qualification, such as one from the Pilates Foundation</p><p><span>Experts say seeking a specialist Pilates teacher is the key.<br></span></p><p><span>One type, APPI (Australian Physiotherapy and Pilates Institute), created ten&nbsp;years ago by two Australian physiotherapists, has adapted the&nbsp;exercises so&nbsp;anyone can do them whatever their ability.<br></span></p><p><span>‘There are several key differences that make APPI better — and safer — for those with back pain,’ says Mr&nbsp;Tucker.</span><br></p><p><span>‘All of the instructors are trained physiotherapists.
