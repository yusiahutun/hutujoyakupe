Not sure what to watch? A regularly updated selection of Vimeo staff picks can help point you in the right direction.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=#>Vimeo makes for a solid YouTube alternative</a> for creators and uploaders for a number of reasons, including its video quality and customization options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dailymotion>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dailymotion</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dailymotion.png><p>Dailymotion is another video website like YouTube.

There are millions of videos uploaded by both professional publishers and amateurs.

That's not to say it is a free-for-all, but the restrictions are far less onerous than those on YouTube. If you struggle to find videos you want to watch on YouTube due to the genre, Utreon is worth checking out.</p><p>If you're a video producer, you don't even need to re-upload your existing video library; Utreon can pull all your videos from YouTube and populate them in your Utreon profile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-internet-archive>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/internet-archive-670x379.png><p>The Internet Archive is a web-based library of all sorts of free content, including books, music, software, and, of course, movies.</p><p>Just as you might associate a physical library with doing research, one of the strengths of The Internet Archive's video content is its vast collection of historical content. While it also has some newer content, some of its best videos are older and obscure news reports, TV series, and movies that are typically hard to find on other sites.</p><p>Like many other sites, users can also upload videos to The Internet Archive.

Gaming is undoubtedly the most popular streaming category on Twitch, with a huge list of specific options to choose from, such as Minecraft, League of Legends, and Overwatch.</p><p>But if gaming isn't your thing, there are also IRL (In Real Life) and Creative categories where you can watch people draw, host general chit-chats, sing, and even cook.</p><p>Most notably, Twitch has broadcast several live music videos from festivals and concerts. International DJ Steve Aoki famously broadcast an entire set from Ibiza in 2014. At the time of writing, Twitch is the official streaming partner for the Ultra Music Festival in Miami.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Twitch, you can follow the streamers you love for free or subscribe to their channel for a monthly fee to support their streaming venture.

It's targeted toward the research community, including those who work with multimedia retrieval and digital libraries.</p><p>With that in mind, most of the videos on The Open Video Project are educational. There are many videos from the archives of NASA and a collection of classic TV commercials and educational films dating back to the 1950s.

TED Talks uploads five to seven new talks every week for you to enjoy.</p><p>Some of the talks are funny, while others are emotional. Some talks are meant to explain how your brain works, while others are there mainly for entertainment. However, the one constant with all the TED Talks videos is that you're likely to take something memorable out of each one.</p><p>The TED Talks website is particularly handy if you're squeezed for time.

However, instead of all the videos being hosted on a central server, the entire site makes use of the Steem blockchain and is thus decentralized. Decentralized platforms are considered safer by many, as they do not have a single point of failure.</p><p>Users who post videos on the site earn Steem (STEEM) crypto tokens which they can transfer to their own cryptocurrency wallets or sell for cash on a cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>A slight twist on DTube is the way metrics are displayed. Instead of showing how many views each video has, the site shows how much crypto each video has earned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=facebook-watch>11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Watch</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/facebook-watch.png><p>Like YouTube, Facebook Watch offers a tailored list of video content for you to dig into.</p><p>There's a variety of series you can check out on Facebook Watch, such as The Real Bros of Simi Valley, Sorry for Your Loss, and Sacred Lies. It's a little harder to find content than on YouTube, as it doesn't have endless categories to choose from. But you can follow the shows you love to keep up to date with new episodes.</p><p>But it's definitely a YouTube alternative worth considering if you enjoy whiling away the hours scrolling through lists of easy-to-watch videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-39-s-worthwhile-trying-youtube-alternatives>It's Worthwhile Trying YouTube Alternatives</h2><p>There's no doubt that YouTube is a top-tier video-sharing platform with a huge array of content to choose from.
