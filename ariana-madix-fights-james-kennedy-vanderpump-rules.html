"He is my prisoner," she added, as cameras caught him throwing her to the bed for a makeout session.</p><p>Schwartz and Raquel Leviss, meanwhile, were spotted setting up galaxy projectors in their respective rooms, after bonding about their shared love of star-inspired lighting at a tea party <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a> threw earlier in the episode.

Scheana was (understandably) miffed when Kristina Kelly -- who made disparaging remarks about her first wedding -- showed up to the gathering uninvited. But Shay didn't have much time to be angry, as another fight soon broke out at the table.</p><p>As Tom and Ariana took their seats, James Kennedy turned to Madix and remarked, "Well, I already nearly got into a fight with someone." Madix responded by saying "the whole thing was s----y," as James said "it wasn't s----y" on his part. As it started to become clear that James had been involved in some sort of altercation earlier, he added, "I think you could tell I had no idea who this human was."</p><p>Through confessionals, viewers got a much better understanding of what happened on the way to the resort.</p><p>Apparently, off camera, one of Brock's "intoxicated" buddies had approached James, exclaiming that they knew each other before giving him "an annoying drunk hug." Kennedy, having no idea who this person was in his space, allegedly "body checked him, hard," according to Lala. James admitted as much, adding, "I should have f---ing Will Smith backhanded him, bitch ass." He also claimed Ariana exclaimed, "James, that's one of Scheana's wedding guests!" during the scuffle.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:83570ae7-98da-4b26-9192-bc2b56889200 data-container-ref=toofab:article:29951b1e-bd36-45c0-88f5-d42859da8cd2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/5by4/2023/03/24/41c230e35e2047d8a341f31437e83d13_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How Vanderpump Rules Cast Reacted After 'Confrontational' Reunion Taping</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Madix felt Kennedy "berated" her with his comments as they sat down, while she believed she was just trying to play peacemaker in the situation. As he kept pushing back, she added, "I wish you could hear your tone of voice when you speak to me, because you've been very f---ing rude to me."</p><p>Kennedy's girlfriend Ally Lewber even agreed, telling him to "chill," while Sandoval just sat silently as his girlfriend and James continued to fight. Raquel, meanwhile, was thrilled she wasn't in Ally's position anymore and no longer had to feel responsible for or embarrassed by Kennedy's behavior.</p><p>James tried to defend himself by saying he was actually showing some restraint by not punching the guy, before telling Ariana he wished she was "more on my side" in this situation. "I'm on the side of not wanting to be in a f---ing fight, period," Madix said, as James said the other man hit him first. With that, she snapped, and exclaimed, "I don't like him doing it and I don't like you doing it, okay?! Period!"</p><p>As he criticized her for raising her voice, she shouted, "I will raise my voice because when I talk at a normal volume, you don't f---ing listen to me and I've had enough. We're done!"</p><p>Ally, meanwhile, said James' behavior started to make her "question everything," including why she was even dating him. The episode ended with Lewber walking out of the restaurant.</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Wednesdays on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b13e2cd9-e83d-46a6-8865-22af16755cf6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:29951b1e-bd36-45c0-88f5-d42859da8cd2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/17/5by4/2023/03/23/17bc9763348945249d12fb2ae99554ed_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jax Taylor Says Tom Sandoval Cheated on Ariana Madix Multiple Times Before Raquel Leviss</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma3Fflr%2Bqrc2aZKaZlJ7FbrLIoJ%2Btq12frq6x0mainqaemrG6edWapZ2doqXCrryMq6ylnaNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html&text=Ariana%20Madix%20Snaps%20at%20James%20Kennedy%20for%20%27Berating%27%20Her%20on%20Scheana%27s%20Wedding%20Weekend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html&title=Ariana%20Madix%20Snaps%20at%20James%20Kennedy%20for%20%27Berating%27%20Her%20on%20Scheana%27s%20Wedding%20Weekend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html&title=Ariana%20Madix%20Snaps%20at%20James%20Kennedy%20for%20%27Berating%27%20Her%20on%20Scheana%27s%20Wedding%20Weekend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html&title=Ariana%20Madix%20Snaps%20at%20James%20Kennedy%20for%20%27Berating%27%20Her%20on%20Scheana%27s%20Wedding%20Weekend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fariana-madix-fights-james-kennedy-vanderpump-rules.html&description=Ariana%20Madix%20Snaps%20at%20James%20Kennedy%20for%20%27Berating%27%20Her%20on%20Scheana%27s%20Wedding%20Weekend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./martha-stewart-thirst-trap-cancelled-flight-fresh-haircut-7376313.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martha Stewarts Latest Thirst Trap Debuted a Fresh Haircut">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./402933-top-10-highest-paid-nfl-kickers-2021-who-earns-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 highest-paid NFL kickers in 2021: Who earns the most?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
