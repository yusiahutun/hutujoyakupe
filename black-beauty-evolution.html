For too long, so many have been quick to either trample on, take credit for, or just completely ignore the efforts of Black creators, artists and business owners. It's been exhausting and caused ruptures across the beauty industry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Growing up in a predominantly white area, my Blackness stuck out, making me immediately ‘different’. This was made ever more obvious by the lack of products available for my skin. Each Saturday shopping trip with my school friends would see them picking up a host of different foundations and concealers, whereas my experience always left me empty handed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a taxing year for Black and ethnic minorities in 2020, the UK government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities determined that “structural racism in the UK does not exist,” although “outright racism still persists”. The commission focused on education, but it's undeniable that racial bias exists within many major business structures - including the beauty industry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/16/black-owned-firms-are-twice-as-likely-to-be-rejected-for-loans-is-this-discrimination data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Guardian</a> article last year stated that “Black business owners often face greater difficulty in getting access to the funds necessary to keep their enterprise afloat – and are twice as likely to have loan applications rejected in comparison to white business owners”. This prompted eight UK-based Black-owned beauty brands to collaborate on the #pullupchallenge, and ask the beauty industry to do better in making sure to give Black-owned businesses a seat at the table.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Slowly, more Black-founded and Black-owned beauty brands are getting the recognition they deserve with help from initiatives like <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://uomabeauty.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="UOMA Beauty’s" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">UOMA Beauty’s</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/pullupforchange/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pull Up For Change" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Pull Up For Change</a>, by Sharon Chuter, which uses its Small Business Fund to support Black businesses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The beauty industry has made huge leaps in recent years in terms of diversity and inclusion. When you browse any high-street store your eyes are now met with a plethora of shades to suit just about every skin tone. But, while its always encouraging to look ahead - and there is still a lot of work to be done - it’s important to look back at how Black beauty has evolved to lead us to this moment.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The idea of a monolithic beauty ideal is so far from realistic<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most of the Black-owned beauty founders I spoke to launched their brands from a need to make space. “How do I create a space that is safe for everyone? How do I change this monolithic view of beauty and make beauty varied?” Chuter questioned. She’s right – the idea of a monolithic beauty ideal is so far from realistic. In fact, even the term, ‘Black beauty’ is reductive, whereas it actually encompasses a broad spectrum of skin tones, hairstyles, and textures. Emolyne Ramlov, founder of beauty brand <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.emolyne.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Emolyne class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emolyne</a> echoes Chuter, telling me, “I also felt majorly underrepresented as someone from an African heritage where the majority of the beauty market is focused on more of a one-size-fits-all notion in terms of colour.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the fact that the number of Black-owned brands we see on shelves today has increased rapidly, many of the founders have faced distinctly similar challenges to get there as Black entrepreneurs. Dr Esho, founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.qvcuk.com/dr-esho/beauty/_/N-1z13xbiZlfm0/c.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Esho Cosmetics" data-vars-ga-product-id=f1475240-fe75-4475-8ad9-f2d4178b1931 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.qvcuk.com/dr-esho/beauty/_/N-1z13xbiZlfm0/c.html data-product-url=https://www.qvcuk.com/dr-esho/beauty/_/N-1z13xbiZlfm0/c.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qvcuk.com%2Fdr-esho%2Fbeauty%2F_%2FN-1z13xbiZlfm0%2Fc.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=qvcuk.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=6c72933f-ca4e-4a0c-a1bf-c26de3a9543d data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=qvcuk.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Esho Cosmetics</a> tells me, “In many ways I have felt like a unicorn – isolated. Stats show it's harder to get venture capital investment for Black-owned companies. Our brands often do not meet the criteria for investment, so you have to wonder why that is.” Make-up artist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/joyadenuga/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joy Adenuga" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Joy Adenuga</a> concurs, saying, “the major challenge from the beginning, and still is a challenge, is race. I’ve lost count of how many opportunities were presented my way but got taken away once they’ve realised I’m Black.” These words hit me with a sharp sting; this feeling of being judged on race is all too familiar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With these brand founders all having faced such specific challenges, it would be naive to put this down to coincidence.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Iman on how to build a successful business" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2021-01-18-at-10-12-06-1610964753.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“What in the talcum powder was on your face in the Nineties?!” Chuter exclaims. The 1990s was really the birth century for ethnic make-up brands. The first pioneering Black beauty brand was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.boots.com/brands/fashion-fair data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fashion Fair" data-vars-ga-product-id=77b6c6f6-5dfe-4edd-af92-b7d82999f4de data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.boots.com/brands/fashion-fair data-product-url=https://www.boots.com/brands/fashion-fair data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Fbrands%2Ffashion-fair" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=boots.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3442d354-a1f5-4139-ad01-44544116669c data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=boots.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Fashion Fair</a>, which launched in 1973 in America, at a time where Black women were mostly neglected and discounted in popular culture. The brand broke new territory; before, there was no way of finding foundations with darker shades, and many people who were darker used formulas with ground-up chalk and unsafe ingredients. The Nineties saw a boom of ‘ethnic aisles’ in American drugstores thanks to the popularity of supermodels including Naomi Campbell and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a35224356/iman-build-successful-business-advice-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Iman class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Iman</a>, but these were often pushed to the back of shops, and there were no luxury offerings. Chuter tells me: “If you wanted to be Black-owned <u>[</u>in the Nineties<u>],</u> you had to be cheap. Even the bigger brands would make products for darker skins that looked - and were - cheap, as if that was the way they thought they would get to us.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, it’s fair to say that the aesthetic Black women were aiming for was far more chic than cheap. Adenuga describes the Black make-up trends in the Nineties as “a predecessor for what we now refer to as a natural, soft, glam look”. She continues: “Celebrities like Lauryn Hill, Halle Berry, Naomi Campbell and Aaliyah wore more understated lip shades likes plums and browns, naturally thick eyebrows and more of a subtle smoky eye.” Liha Okunniwa, founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/liha data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Liha data-vars-ga-product-id=5e24b9e3-2e32-4c54-bdcb-b907587323db data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/liha data-product-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/liha data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fdesigner%2Fliha" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=net-a-porter.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=0e21db79-5b2a-4bfb-8e7a-97c0985161a7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=net-a-porter.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Liha</a>, adds that the look was about “always making sure you are glowing from head-to-toe”. Glowing skin, now, is universally considered the Holy Grail. But during the Nineties, there was still a severe lack of shades for all, with Okunniwa noting that she had to use a dark brown eyeliner for her lips during the decade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then came the Noughties, which really saw its own evolution within the Black beauty sphere. Emolyne tells me: “Pat McGrath has always been a driving force, but especially in this era when she won the L’Oreal Pro-V Makeup Artist of the Year award two years running.” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/pat-mcgrath-labs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pat McGrath Labs" data-vars-ga-product-id=0218918a-6210-4726-a932-2544646dc293 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/pat-mcgrath-labs data-product-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/designer/pat-mcgrath-labs data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fdesigner%2Fpat-mcgrath-labs" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=net-a-porter.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=0bfeb8c6-24d5-4dd9-a721-6303985e3b1f data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=net-a-porter.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Pat McGrath Labs</a>, the brand from the iconic British make-up artist, was one of the most highly anticipated releases of the decade, with sleek, luxury packaging and inclusive shades really raising the bar in the wider beauty industry. Adenuga describes the look of the Noughties as “a bit more glam, playful and experimental. We’re talking emerald green and blue eyeshadows, thinly plucked eyebrows and heavily glossed lips lined with a brown or plum liner.” McGrath's products really provided all the tools for this look, and Black women didn’t have to compromise on quality.</p><img alt="evolution of black beauty" title="Evolution of Black beauty" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/black-beauty-evolution-1634734901.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Keisha East notes one of the biggest transformations to the beauty world was the inception of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harveynichols.com/brand/fenty-beauty/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fenty Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=2e31082c-2356-4764-b184-ae943635663c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.harveynichols.com/brand/fenty-beauty/ data-product-url=https://www.harveynichols.com/brand/fenty-beauty/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand=harveynichols.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=cc65b026-985c-4e86-9fcc-7bd3cfe94864 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=harveynichols.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Fenty Beauty</a> in 2017. “It changed the game again, making it super accessible to find all types of shades in mainstream stores.” Upon its creation, it was announced that Rihanna’s eponymous brand would be releasing 40 shades of foundation. Until this point, many brands would release around half of that number with just three or so darker shades, under the assumption that either darker skin tones would have to fit into this one-size-fits-all, or go elsewhere. Since then we’ve seen a dramatic push to incorporate more deeper tones into foundation lines across the board.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s no such thing as multicultural beauty," Chuter feels - it should be a given that 'beauty' is inclusive of difference by its very nature. Instead, she suggests, we should call out brands as monocultural if they aren't welcoming of diversity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In order for something to be truly inclusive, it has to start from the inside. Beauty companies must have diverse teams so that this change is organic, and they’ll be able to point out the specific flaws in shades and products before they hit shelves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The beauty world has come on leaps and bounds, but let’s face it, there’s still work to be done - and it’s not just on Pat McGrath and Rihanna to pioneer the changes. Chuter is right, “the world is a bad place only because we’re unwilling to accept each other’s differences”.
