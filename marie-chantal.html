I had my first three children [Olympia, Constantine and Achileas] in New York, where my husband [Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece; though the European country abolished its monarchy in 1973] and I were living after we got married. I was immersed in parenthood and was having fun but by the time I was pregnant with Achileas, I had this incredible drive to go out and do something on my own. There was a baby boom and the luxury industry was moving into children's products. I remembered my mother-in-law [Queen Anne-Marie] bringing me beautiful smock dresses and pretty English clothes, which I couldn't find in New York at the time. So I thought what fun it would be to bring it all together in one shop. That was nine years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A HONG KONG CHILDHOOD The way my mother would dress us when we were small inspires me. She is South American and she loved us to look perfect; we were three little girls so you can imagine - perfectly dressed, perfect hair. In the summer there were lovely cotton dresses, gingham and Liberty prints; I love designing summer collections because it takes me back. I was born in London in 1968, my sister Pia was born two years earlier in New York. My father [billionaire entrepreneur Robert Warren Miller] had already co-founded the business that was to become Duty Free Shoppers [DFS] and we moved back to Hong Kong 18 months after my birth. My sister Alexandra was born there in 1972.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People can't imagine what it was like when they see the metropolis today. It was so different then: there was a cricket ground in Central [now Chater Square], where we had our school sports days. I remember going out on junks and waking up to the sight of the beautiful old fishing boats with their big fan sails. This was just everyday life, like taking a ferry to the airport before they built the tunnel. It wasn't so packed with people then, everything happened at a slower pace. I go back to Hong Kong every year, because my parents still live there and my sisters and I are on the board of DFS. My father is still very hands-on and doesn't want to retire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DADDY'S GIRL I am very independent, as is my third son, Odysseas, who shares my birthday and Chinese zodiac sign. We are Monkeys. I inherited my creative side from my mother; I love to paint and draw and do a lot of illustration for books. The other elements [to her makeup] come from my father; growing up I could see my father was devoted to business but also was very much a family man who would come home and have lunch with us three days a week. He encouraged me to go out and learn how to put a business plan together. It may have been tough but that is what I needed to prove to myself I could do it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">THE MILLERS' TALE I was sent to Switzerland, to [boarding school] Le Rosey in Gstaad, when I was nine. It was awful; I hated it. Then my parents bought a house in Paris, which they refurbished, and we moved there when I was 13 and I learnt to speak fluent French. When Pia left school to go to Barnard [College] at Columbia University I followed her and did my last year of boarding school at the Masters School, in New York. When I was 16, I was introduced to [pop artist] Andy Warhol and went to work at the Factory [his studio] as an assistant making tea, answering calls. This was followed by a scholarship to the New York Academy of Art, which was full of unbelievably talented people - but I didn't finish the year. I then went to New York University to do art history - I dropped out of that as well. I was curious and went and did things that would satisfy me and then I would move on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">FLASH POINT In 1992, some Greek friends were having a party in New Orleans, which a friend dragged me along to, and there I met my husband. Six months after getting engaged in Switzerland we were married in London, in 1995. I am sure you have read all about it. Someone gave me one key piece of advice: '[Your wedding] goes by in such a flash, get your brain to do a snapshot memory.' So I really focused on every single thing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">GREEK DRAMA When I married my husband it was difficult to understand why we couldn't go to Greece. His family was in exile [Prince Pavlos was born in Greece in 1967 but his father, King Constantine II, was forced into exile by a military coup later that year and the family settled in London].</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We started married life in New York, which we thought would be better for the two of us and my husband's career, which was in shipping. Like Hong Kong it has that fast pace and energy. I launched my [eponymous] children's clothing line, in 2000. My husband had moved into hedge funds and after we had our third child we moved to London [where she opened her first children's shop, in 2003]. He wanted to bring our children closer to his roots. [The royal family has subsequently been given permission to visit Greece.]</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Odysseas was christened in Athens and then I opened a shop there in 2005. Thousands turned up; they had to close the whole street. It was a great moment for my husband and I. Now I can't imagine not spending time in Greece - we absolutely adore it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmbYN2f5dopJqqmZp6pLTAp6uapA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarie-chantal.html&text=Marie%20Chantal%20%7c%20South%20China%20Morning%20Post&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarie-chantal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarie-chantal.html&title=Marie%20Chantal%20%7c%20South%20China%20Morning%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarie-chantal.html&title=Marie%20Chantal%20%7c%20South%20China%20Morning%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarie-chantal.html&title=Marie%20Chantal%20%7c%20South%20China%20Morning%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarie-chantal.html&description=Marie%20Chantal%20%7c%20South%20China%20Morning%20Post" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-purpose-of-automation-testing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is the Purpose of Automation Testing? | 5 Best Purpose">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./love-blinds-zack-goytowski-candidly-discusses-heartache-mothers-death-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Love Is Blind's Zack Goytowski candidly discusses heartache over his mother's death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
