Jana worked at the Mount Vernon Good Samaritan hospital and went to college to get her associate <a href=#>degree in nursing</a>. She only had one year before her graduation in 1988. On the other hand, Jana's husband worked at a local printing firm.</p><h2>What happened to Jana Reynolds?</h2><p class=align-left>May 5, 1988, was an ordinary day for Jana Reynolds and her husband, Jeff. Jeff left the house for work around 10:00 pm and bade her wife goodbye with a kiss as he usually did. However, upon arrival at his house the following morning, he noticed something strange.</p><p class=align-left>His wife's car was still in the carport, which was not ordinary. But, by the time Jeff comes home from work, his wife is already gone to school. So, he advanced to his house, wondering what might have caused his wife not to go to school.</p><p class=align-left>The first reg flag as he was entering <a href=#>the house </a>was the back door. He realized that it was broken into. And he was met with the terrible sight after making his way to the bedroom. Jana was lying on the bed in a pool of blood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28b1850dc2040714.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr John Cavaness: The story of the deadly doctor of Eldorado</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Of course, that is not what he expected when coming home from work, and it was shocking and puzzling. Jeff called 911 to inform the police about the incident, and he was pretty hysterical during the call.</p><p class=align-left>The police arrived a few minutes later and started studying the crime scene for possible clues. Jana's body was lying on the bed with her thermal pyjama bottoms. However, her panties were pulled down, hanging on her leg.</p><p class=align-left>Also, which might have been her cause of death was her throat and wrist condition. Her throat was cut, and her wrist lacerated, which was hardly attaching to her arm. With the visible evidence, investigators started working toward building a case and getting the culprit.</p><h2>Who did the investigators suspect initially?</h2><p class=align-left>It is ordinary for murder cases to have the husband as one of the prime suspects. Bu not Jana Reynold's case. Jeff had a profound alibi as he was at work the entire time.
