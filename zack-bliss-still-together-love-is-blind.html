During their 10 days in “The Pods”, the couples decide if they wanted to get engaged—still sight unseen—or end their relationships for a better connection with someone else. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on a honeymoon, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on Netlix in 2020, the show has become one of service’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Zack and Bliss. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Zack and Bliss still together from Love Is Blind season 4</a>? Read on for what we know about if Zack and Bliss are still together from Love Is Blind season 4 and where they are now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zack-Bliss-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p>Are Zack and Bliss still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer is yes. Zack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi were one of three couples who got married in the Love Is Blind season 4 finale. Public court records from King County, Washington, where Seattle is located and Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed, also confirmed this. According to King County’s official records search, Zack and Bliss received a marriage application on April 26, 2022, and obtained their marriage certificate on May 24, 2022. They were one of three couples from Love Is Blind season 4 who obtained marriage certificates, confirming they got married. Both the marriage application and marriage certificate list the grantor as “Bliss Shahdi Erika Poureetezadi” and the grantee as “Zachary Joseph Goytowski.”</p><p>Zack and Bliss confirmed they were still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw them living together. In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale, Zack confirmed that his relationship with Bliss’ father had improved after their wedding. “He has called me his son. It felt really good, honestly,” Zack said of a moment between him and Bliss’ father at their wedding. “He gave me this look of approval. Like a nod. He may not necessarily have agreed with our decision, but he respected me, so that definitely meant a lot.” As for his and Bliss’ marriage at the time, Zach told Entertainment Tonight, “It’s really good. It’s great, honestly.” Zach added of his in-laws, “I love Bliss’ family. They’re amazing.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale, Bliss looked back on her wedding day with Zack. “Oh my gosh. I’m amazed,” she said. “And I really want to give props to all the people behind the scenes that make this stuff happen, and make the pods, and the experience, and everything go around. It’s so much work.” She continued, “I was in love with how everything looked. It was absolutely beautiful. It was just what I imagined. I really loved it. And it was everything that I wanted.” Bliss also called her and Zack’s first dance—which was to Lee Ann Womack and The Sons’ “I Hope You Dance,” a song they bonded over in The Pods—”so beautiful and wonderful.” Bliss continued of her “perfect” wedding day: “There were dresses set out for me that I was looking through. And I was like, hmm. But then this dress actually got shipped to the location that we were at, literally while we were there. It was just this magical moment. Everything just felt so serendipitous and beautiful.”</p><p>She added, “That was the dress. That was it. Because everything else just wasn’t hitting the mark for me, and it literally shipped there while we were filming there. And it was amazing,” she notes. “I loved that dress. It was perfect. Everything that kept happening after we got back together just kept affirming that this was the right thing.”</p><p>Bliss also revealed to People that she and Zack “discussed” whether they were planning to say “I do” or “I don’t” at the altar. “We had agreed and discussed about saying yes,” she said. “I wanted there to be space for us to say no at the altar if we decided that we were going to say no. I wanted to make sure that I gave that for both of us, because you never want anyone to be forced into a situation. But we were going to say yes, and we knew that we were going to say yes.”</p><p>The conversation over their wedding came after Bliss’ father’s doubt over her and Zack’s fast relationship. “Honestly, that’s just my dad’s personality. He’s going to be skeptical. I expected him to be skeptical… I would’ve been more weirded out or surprised if he wasn’t skeptical because that’s just how he is,” she said. “But I knew that my dad, ultimately at the end of the day, is going to trust me to make the right decision for myself.” She continued, “It wasn’t even a matter of him not accepting who Zack was. It was more just not accepting of a marriage so quickly. I think that’s important to make that distinction because it had nothing to do with who Zack was as a person, if that makes sense.”</p><p>Bliss also told People that she hoped her and Zack’s relationship sends a message to viewers about the importance of second chances.&nbsp;“My hope is that they see that this really is a story of second chances that we’ve all really needed. This man gave me no reason to not trust in his honesty and his intentions. So, I hope that’s what they see,” she said.</p><p>Zack and Bliss met in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4, but didn’t get engaged after Zack broke up with Bliss to propose to Irina. Zack and Irina broke up in episode 5 at the end of their vacation in Mexico after they both realized their relationship wasn’t working. Zack and Bliss reunited after Zack’s breakup with Irina and got engaged.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023, Irina also responded to her feud with Bliss, who Zack rejected before he got engaged to Irina. “Me and Bliss didn’t have the best moments in the lounge, but I have absolutely no harsh feelings towards her,” Irina said. Irina also revealed that she encouraged Zack to pursue Bliss after their breakup. “I think what’s meant to be, will be,” she said.</p><p>Irina also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that she and Bliss have no animosity.&nbsp;“Before me and Zack broke up, I told him, if he wanted to go to pursue something with Bliss that he should,” she said. “I have no bad blood with her at all, but I could see how she could have some bad blood with me,” She continued, “Obviously, that’s going to be uncomfortable or hard maybe to watch. But me and Zack weren’t supposed to be together, and we are not together for a reason.”</p><p>Bliss, for her part, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in April 2023 that she “didn’t have any expectations” when she and Zack reunited, though she admitted “there was a very intense physical chemistry that really just shocked me when I walked in.” “There really wasn’t [any hesitation]. He just showed me the person that he is over and over again. I felt like I knew that he was my person,” she said of Zack’s proposal. “Honestly, I was so shocked. I had no idea it was coming. I’m glad I was surprised with it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zach-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.jpg><p>Who is Zack from Love Is Blind season 4?

Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia; season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois; and season 3 was filmed in Dallas, Texas. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nick-Lachey-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>The Love Is Blind season 4 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p><span class=s1>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Us </i></span><span class=s3><i>Weekly</i></span></a></span><span class=s4>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined <i>Love Is Blind</i> if he was single. “I would.
