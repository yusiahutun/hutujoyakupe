All thanks to characters like Johnny Jett who are a breath of fresh air whenever they appear in the show. While the Barnwood Builders star keeps his personal life on a low-key note, we know that he is married to a woman named Donna Jett. The article will be all about Johnny’s wife, Donna Jett.</p><h3><strong>Meet Barnwood Builders Johnny Jett Wife, Donna Jett</strong></h3><p>As we all know, the 72-years-old Fleming County native makes his living putting log cabins and barns together to make modern houses on the DIY Network show <a href=#>Barnwood Builders</a>.</p><p>Johnny has been in the cabin building business for a long time. His experience with log cabins began after he returned from service in Vietnam. While he was living on the family farm with his wife and a young son, he wanted to live in a log cabin. Since Johnny’s brother, Billy, an accomplished carpenter, was in the business of moving and assembling cabins for customers, it was not long before they found a prospect in the cabin building business.</p><p>While we don’t know when and how Johnny Jett and his wife Donna Jett met each other for the first time, the two reportedly exchanged wedding vows on July 30, 1972. On July 29, 2018, Donna requested Choco the Macho Chihuahua on Facebook to sing a happy anniversary to her and her husband, Johnny, as they were about to celebrate 46 years of marriage on July 30th that same year.</p><p>Johnny and his wife, Donna had an only kid, a son named Johnny Gene Jett. Unfortunately, Johnny’s only son passed away on October 22, 2017, at the young age of 44. While not much is known about Johnny, he was a heavy equipment operator with Local Union 181. Furthermore, he also used to attend the Victory Baptist Church in Flemingsburg.</p><p>Johnny’s deceased son also had two kids of his own, Jonathan and Nicholas Jett.</p><p>While we don’t know much about Jonathan, Nicholas’ Facebook tells us that he is engaged to a woman named Hannah Jent. Nicholas’ fiancee studies at Eastern Kentucky University.</p><h3><strong>Donna Jett Age</strong></h3><p>Born in the year 1955, Donna Jett’s age was 67 as of July 2022, according to radaris.com.</p><h3><strong>Donna Jett Job</strong></h3><p>Coming to Donna Jett’s job and career, we, unfortunately, did not know much about it as of July 2022. However, it looks like Donna has long retired from her job.</p><p>There’s a lot to talk about Donna’s husband Johnny’s career though. Barnwood Builders star developed pickup up an interest in operating machinery at a young age. Very often, he was seen tinkering with anything he could find.</p><p>Johnny entered into the cabin building business after his brother died of a heart attack in the middle of a cabin build at Cave Run Lake. To cope with the grief of losing his brother, Johnny decided to finish the cabin for his brother. He resigned from his job as a backhoe driver at the Fleming County Water Association and sought help from a friend named Sherman Thompson–also a cast member of Barnwood Builder–to finish the project. Upon the completion of the project, both Johnny and Sherman felt they should go into the log cabin business.</p><p>In 1996, the duo started contracting for Mark Bowe, now starring on Barnwood Builders as well. Johnny and Sherman started working for Mark full-time in 1998, and in no time their business attracted the attention of the DIY Network. The first season of Barnwood Builders eventually aired in 2013.</p><p>Apart from Barnwood Builders, Johnny also appeared in the documentary Down Home: Where the Past Is Present in 2016. Johnny is also interested in art, especially paintings.</p><p>Reportedly, Johnny Jett earns as much as $10 thousand per episode from the show Barnwood Builders. As of today, his net worth was estimated to be around $400 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Is Donna Jett On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, Donna Jett was not on Instagram as of this writing. Although she does have a Facebook account, she has not posted anything on the platform since October 2018.</p><h3><strong>What Is Donna Jett Maiden Name?</strong></h3><p>Donna Jett’s maiden name has been revealed to be Marshall.</p><h3><strong>Donna Jett Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Donna Jett’s family, her parents are Raymond and Norma Conley Marshall. Both her parents passed away long ago.</p><p>Donna Jet’s parents-in-law, or Johnny’s parents, are not alive either. Donna’s father-in-law, Gene Jett, passed away on July 19, 2022, at the age of 91. For 43 years, he was the superintendent of Fleming County Water Association and owner/operator of Jett Heating and Plumbing. Donna’s mother-in-law, Leota Hawkins, passed away even earlier than her husband Gene, on May 16, 2010, at the Fleming County Hospital in Flemingsburg.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Donna Jett From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Although we don’t know where Donna Jett is originally from, she currently resides in Wallingford, Kentucky.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Does Donna Jett Appear On Barnwood Builders?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Donna Jett has never appeared on the DIY Network show Barnwood Builders. Her husband, Johnny Jett, however, has been on the show since its inaugural season. As of this writing, the TV star has appeared in a total of 124 episodes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqlu82nmGailanBbq7Aq6Wwp5%2BZeqPByKWbnqqjYrewtM2nsGailanBbsPIn5xo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html&text=Meet%20Donna%20Jett%21%20Age%2c%20Job&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html&title=Meet%20Donna%20Jett%21%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html&title=Meet%20Donna%20Jett%21%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html&title=Meet%20Donna%20Jett%21%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-donna-jett-barnwood-builders-johnny-jett-wife.html&description=Meet%20Donna%20Jett%21%20Age%2c%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lashana-lynch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lashana Lynch dating?
