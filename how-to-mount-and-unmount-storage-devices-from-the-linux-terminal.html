This is a powerful and versatile tool---here's everything you need to know.</p><h2 id=the-linux-file-system>The Linux File System</h2><p>The file systems in Linux, macOS, and other <a href=#>Unix-like operating systems</a> don't use separate volume identifiers for storage devices in the way that, say, Windows does. Windows assigns each volume a drive letter such as C: or D: and the file system for each volume is a tree of directories sitting below that drive letter.</p><p>In Linux, the file system is an all-in-one directory tree. A mounted storage device has its file system grafted onto that tree so that it appears to be an integral part of one cohesive file system. The newly mounted file system will be accessible via the directory to which it is mounted. That directory is called the mount point for that file system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many file systems are auto-mounted at boot time or on-the-fly as storage volumes connected to the computer during runtime. Cautious system admins can turn off the runtime auto-mount features so that they can control connections to the system.</p><p>This means storage devices connected during runtime might not auto-mount and will require mounting manually. Mounting a file system manually lets you make decisions about that file system, such as where the mount point will be and whether the file system is going to be read-only or read-write.</p><p>Whether it is out of necessity or through choice, the <code>mount</code>, <code>umount</code> and <code>remount</code> commands give you the ability to take control of this important aspect of your Linux system.</p><h2 id=interrogate-your-file-system-with-mount>Interrogate Your File System With mount</h2><p>Mount has a <a href=#>great many options</a>, but to list all of the mounted file systems on your computer requires no options at all.

We get a much more manageable output.</p><p>A <code>tmpfs</code> file system appears as though it were a regular, mounted file system but it is actually stored in volatile memory---the tmp stands for temporary---instead of on a persistent storage device.</p><p>You'll want to substitute the <code>tmpfs</code> parameter for the file type in which you are interested.</p><p>We've also issued a command to list <code>ext4</code> file systems. On this test computer, there is a single <code>ext4</code> file system, it is on device <code>sda</code>---the first storage device mounted, usually the main hard drive---and mounted on <code>/</code>, which is the root of the file system tree.</p><p>The other indicators mean:</p><ul><li>rw: The file system is readable and writable.</li><li>relatime: The kernel is using an optimized scheme to record file access and modification meta-data.</li><li>errors=remount -o: If a sufficiently serious error is detected, the file system will be remounted in read-only mode to allow diagnosis.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=interrogate-your-file-system-with-df>Interrogate Your File System With df</h2><p>The <code>df</code> command can also be used to <a href=#>display which file systems are mounted</a> and where their mount points are.</p><p><code>df</code> used with no parameters gives you the same information overload problem as <code>mount</code>. As an example, in Ubuntu Linux, there is a <code>squashfs</code> pseudo-file system created for each and every application that has been installed using the <code>snap</code> command.

In this example, we happen to be using a <a href=#>Tiny Core Linux</a> ISO because it is conveniently small and quick to download. (A tiny Linux distribution with a GUI, in 18 MB! You probably have .mp3 files bigger than that.)</p><p>In the same directory as the ISO image, issue this command. Substitute the name of the ISO file that you are mounting.</p><pre>sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop TinyCore-current.iso /mnt</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/mount_3.png><p>Because we need to use <code>sudo</code> you'll need to enter your password.</p><p>The <code>-t</code> (type) option tells <code>mount</code> what type of file system we are mounting. It is an ISO file, so we provide the <code>iso9660</code> type specifier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <code>-o</code> (options) flag is used to pass extra parameters to <code>mount</code>. Our parameter is <code>loop</code>.</p><p>We're using <code>loop</code> to force <code>mount</code> to use a loop device file to connect to our ISO image. A loop device file allows a file (like the ISO image) to be mounted and treated as though it were a storage device.</p><p>Device files are special files used as an interface so that connected devices appear as though they were a normal file system file. This is part of the <a href=#>everything in Linux is a file</a> design philosophy.</p><p>There are many different types of device files. We saw one earlier when we noted that the only <code>ext4</code> file system on this test machine was mounted on <code>/</code> and was called <code>sda</code>.</p><p>To be more accurate, that <code>ext4</code> file system is on a storage device connected to the file system through the <code>/dev/sda</code> device file and the file system on that storage device mounted at <code>/</code>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have to provide the name of the ISO image of course, and we need to let <code>mount</code> know where we'd like the file system to be mounted. We have chosen <code>/mnt</code>.</p><p>The ISO image is mounted. A reminder that ISO images are always mounted in read-only mode appears in the terminal window.</p><h2 id=exploring-the-iso-image>Exploring the ISO Image</h2><p>Now that it is mounted we can navigate the directories in the ISO image in the same way as any other part of the file system.
