'I lived in a village called Savu Savu. We grew our own food. Taro, cassava, yam, sweet potato. Pigs for pork. The farm was a one-hour walk up the hill. I was brought up on the sugar cane farm. I lived there for 18 years and never left.</p><br><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the time I was still in high school and I was going to get job at Westpac bank. The Westpac manager wanted me to go and work there after school because I was good at maths. We didn't have the money to send me to university so my parents saw that as a job opportunity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I didn't want to work for the bank so I ran away. Ran to the city. It was a Friday. When I left home that morning, I had already packed my stuff to run away after my last exam paper.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-f6f8c0e7fb87bbd7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/08/06/76295041-12606983-image-a-14_1696743526093.jpg height=449 width=634 alt="Fiji star Frank Lomani has told of how he ran away from home to pursue his rugby dream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Fiji star Frank Lomani has told of how he ran away from home to pursue his rugby dream</p><img id=i-49ecd43c8567bbd5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/08/06/76295051-12606983-image-a-15_1696743574099.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The scrum-half and Fiji are on a collision course with England in the World Cup quarter-finals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The scrum-half and Fiji are on a collision course with England in the World Cup quarter-finals&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I took the ferry, 13 hours. My uncle gave me my one-way fare to Suva. It was 56 bucks and he gave me 60, so I slept on the ferry with four dollars in my pocket. I bought one roti parcel and then had two dollars left.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I got into the city in the evening, saw all these big buildings and lights and thought, 'Oh my God!' I was only used to one or two storey buildings.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My uncle came to pick me up from the jetty and I asked him not to tell my parents. They thought I'd gone to the sugar cane farm to work. Little did they know I had caught the ferry to Suva!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The gold veneer on Lomani's front tooth catches the sun as he speaks. A result of dental treatment after an elbow to his mouth while playing rugby in his village.&nbsp;He explains how he never tires of telling this story.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sitting in the courtyard following Fiji's team hotel in Bordeaux, he continues: 'My parents didn't want me to play rugby. My dad wanted me to be a soccer player and earn big money.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We had Saturday classes at school… I wore my uniform on the bus, got off at the field, changed my uniform and played rugby! I played for the village team the whole year! Every Saturday! My parents never knew.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In the village, we played touch rugby after school every afternoon. When I got to Suva, I went to this school where they played touch rugby, every day for two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My parents rang my family at the sugar cane field and they said, 'Oh, he's not here'. They called around and found out I was in Suva. They found out on the Friday and told my uncle to send me back on the next boat on the Sunday.</p><img id=i-9e4a19511e2cfb8d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/08/06/76295057-12606983-image-a-16_1696743607655.jpg height=404 width=634 alt="Fiji need a point against Portugal on Sunday to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 2007" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Fiji need a point against Portugal on Sunday to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 2007</p><img id=i-b04f278a6d4a34b6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/08/06/76295063-12606983-image-a-17_1696743661917.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Lomani tackles Australia's Jordan Petaia during their group stage meeting last month" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lomani tackles Australia's Jordan Petaia during their group stage meeting last month</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That Saturday there was a club game in Suva, for Marist Rugby Club. I was coming home from touch rugby, walking home on the road and I could hear someone calling from the back saying, 'Our coach wants you to come back because we are short on numbers!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I went into the club, didn't know anyone, played wing and scored two tries. I didn't know the Fiji Under-20 coach was watching. I was 19.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The 20s coach asked my coach if I wanted to play for Fiji 20s, then Ben Ryan was watching and he recruited me for sevens. I never played for the sevens team but I never gave up.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Ben Ryan told me that if I want to make it big then I need to go elsewhere, so I went to 15s. So that was the start…'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eight years later and here we are. Unless there is a seismic upset in Nimes on Sunday night, Fiji will face England in the quarter-final in Marseille.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They have formed a steely edge under Simon Raiwalui. Lomani has become a key figure, kicking goals, jackaling and feeding off any scraps.</p><img id=i-93fa7c51b8e7b8b4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/08/06/76295071-12606983-image-a-18_1696743717291.jpg height=481 width=634 alt="Lomani says Fiji's style is just the same as they'd play back home in his village" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lomani says Fiji's style is just the same as they'd play back home in his village</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You know how we offload and all that? How we play now is how they play back in the village. We say, 'Play like a Fijian'. That's our DNA and you can't take that away from us. We played on a ground with holes everywhere, we played on roundabouts. If we didn't have a ball we would tie a T-shirt together and use that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I have been in this environment for eight years now and this team is growing. The world knew Fiji as a 40-minute team but it's way different to how it was before. You can see that every team now plays Fiji as if we are a tier one nation, as if we are a threat.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fiji need a point against Portugal on Sunday to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 2007. Lomani says: 'I was in year six. Back then, we didn't have TVs in the village. I remember listening to it on the radio. The radio was hung up so you could get reception. Everyone was stood around it in the middle of the night.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They put a benchmark where every team after them has tried to reach. Every Fiji team that goes to the Rugby World Cup wants to reach that.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The class of 2023 are next in line. Listening to Lomani, they clearly have an ability to inspire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9GunpuxpaO2sLqOmqmtoZOhsm59kW9nb3FoaHyHvsCnomaEn6Kur7WMq5inZZGsrrp5x6iknmWaqsC1ecWorKtldp63qq3NZpuopJyWv7R5z6iapJ2kYq63u8idZKGZpp67qHnWqKmkZZKWu6x50pyprqVdna6tsoygrKemmaO0bp7UoJmyZYekv62wjHysqWWYnsC1u9GyZJqfkZ67tMCMfqWgpJGjsW%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html&text=Frank%20Lomani%20ran%20away%20from%20home%20with%20just%20four%20Fijian%20dollars%20in%20his%20pocket%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20work%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html&title=Frank%20Lomani%20ran%20away%20from%20home%20with%20just%20four%20Fijian%20dollars%20in%20his%20pocket%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20work%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html&title=Frank%20Lomani%20ran%20away%20from%20home%20with%20just%20four%20Fijian%20dollars%20in%20his%20pocket%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20work%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html&title=Frank%20Lomani%20ran%20away%20from%20home%20with%20just%20four%20Fijian%20dollars%20in%20his%20pocket%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20work%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrank-lomani-ran-away-home-just-four-fijian-dollars-pocket-avoid-having-work-bank-scrum-half-gunning-rugby-world-cup-history-against-england-html.html&description=Frank%20Lomani%20ran%20away%20from%20home%20with%20just%20four%20Fijian%20dollars%20in%20his%20pocket%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20work%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./love-island-australias-ari-kumar-turns-heat-poses-beachside-photoshoot-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Love Island Australia's Ari Kumar turns up the heat as she poses beachside for a photoshoot">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./a-night-of-music-at-songwriters-in-the-round.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Night of Music at Songwriters in the Round">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
