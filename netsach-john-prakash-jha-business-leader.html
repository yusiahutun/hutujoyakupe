Also, the growth of various sectors and some particular domains in the field of business and start-ups. Many new companies and start-ups have come up providing a wide range of products and services and that too online so it is readily available to the consumer and without any hassle and long wait.</p><p>As there has been a huge shift of population to the world of the internet that it has raised and created a lot of troubles too as everything comes with a price, the price, in this case, is our data, privacy security, etc. all in all cybersecurity.</p><p>John Prakash Jha is the CEO and founder of Netsach. He understands the importance of the internet in human’s lives and its role played in the overall development of a persona and the amenities it offers but not at the cost of data and someone’s privacy. He founded Netsach to provide a very high standard and quality of cybersecurity to people and companies alike. He understood the gap and is perfectly bridging it with his arsenal of products lined up to raise the bar of cybersecurity.</p><p>He is not only an avid thinker, an entrepreneur, an expert but also an outstanding leader as he has brought Netsach forth to the reputation and status it truly deserves. John with <a href=# rel=noopener>Netsach</a> and exemplary thinking and skills is what makes him one of the top 10 business leaders who can transform the way we look and consume certain products and services.</p><p>In conversation with Mr. John Prakash Jha, let’s discover how he revolutionized the way we look at cyber security and the solution he has to all kinds of <a href=#>cyber security threats</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the products/services Netsach focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</h3><p>Netsach – a <a href=#>cybersecurity company</a> primarily works on 5 areas which are web security, cloud security, infrastructure security, application security, and IoT security. Within each of them, we have a product, service, and support platform.&nbsp;</p><p>We have products on alert notification, Threat detection, IoT Security, GRC, and are in process of creating of few cybersecurity bots.</p><p>In our service platform, we specialize in our service platform which includes, VAPT (Ethical hacking), BAS (Breach attack Simulation), Threat detection, Digital forensics, Compliance like ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPPA, etc.</p><p>We as well manage SOC and other support-related projects on cyber security, as well as, help in a few cyber securities awareness training to technical training to cyber security recruitment.&nbsp;Netsach as a company aims to become a one-stop-shop for all cyber security requirements in days to come.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you decide to take Netsach a step further in terms of your products/services?</h3><p>Both Vertical and Horizontal expansion is in place. Netsach as a company will be present in Israel (Global cyber security Hub) and next year will are expanding our footprint in the UAE market. By doing so we look for creating several avenues, a business prospect from various countries. Our India office will be focused more on delivery and support.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?&nbsp;</h3><p>John strongly believes that his people are his true strength and some of the practices that they meticulously follow are given below:</p><ul><li>Professional Workplace</li><li>Open Communication</li><li>Advanced Opportunities</li><li>Recognition</li><li>Benefits</li><li>Recreation</li><li>Constant encouragement on training to upgrade their skill.</li></ul><p>And these practices not only create a sound and peaceful work atmosphere but also add to the mental levels of the employees, making them feel safer and content, thus pushing everyone to do their best and provide the best results possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is there any special experience with your clients you would like to highlight?&nbsp;</h3><p>Great customer service goes beyond fixing computers, bugs, etc.</p><p>It is about leaving the customer with an experience and this is what we strive for with each customer. Each customer is unique to us and has left a special memory for us to cherish and we continue to deliver an amazing customer experience every time we work with them.</p><p>Few pointers we have made clear:</p><ul><li>Our quality of work proves one of the highest in the market.</li><li>Are reports and documents are up to the mark of the industry standard.</li><li>Establish clean and clear communication with our customer</li><li>Get real-time feedback.</li><li>Build a relationship to grow along the journey</li></ul><p>To highlight, I can mention one of the customer stories where we were supposed to deliver digital forensic and we had a tough time due to the smartness of the attacker and I remember very clearly, we were running out of our schedule. I and my team went beyond our limitations, worked non-stop 40+ hours, and were able to deliver our reports.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is there any new addition to the list of products/services? Anything exciting you would like to share?&nbsp;</h3><p>Yes, we are currently working on various cybersecurity bots which will help our customers to perform automated monitoring and further deep dive on the internet for research and automating maintenance tasks on the web thereby enhancing security in the future.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It’s a rat race out there. How do you cope with that?&nbsp;</h3><p>We have believed that technology has enhanced to a very high extent and in days to come the advancement of technology will be even more. We have always believed that today we should prepare for tomorrow and for most of our competency we try to keep ourselves updated with upcoming technology. Though there is a race I don’t see a rat race in the space of cybersecurity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The person, the man, the leader behind Netsach</strong></h2><p>John Prakash Jha, (CEO and founder of Netsach) holds dual masters and many other certifications in cybersecurity, is a highly influential person in the space of cybersecurity/Information Security, and is highly productive, innovative, and is an effective professional with polished communication and interpersonal skills. His role in the organization involves creating, communicating, and implementing the vision, mission, and overall direction. John takes up the task of formulation and implementation of strategic plans while leading, directing, and evaluating the work of other executive leaders in the organization.</p><p>He admires Ratan Naval Tata for the businessman but more than that for the leader he is and how he takes Netsach and employees and treats them with equality and respect, making sure that everyone rises with Netsach and no one is left behind when it comes to overall development and progress. He is highly inspired by Elon Musk, who is not only a world-renowned and one of the most successful and famous businessmen alive, but little do we remember and know the hardships, troubles, and struggles he faced before making it into the hall of fame.</p><p>John finds Elon Musk’s story inspiring mostly due to his unwavering spirit and ability to overcome disappointment. He feels Constant vigilance is a need and should have the right strategy and the right framework. Today we see a rise of 419 new threats per minute and with this rise, we must need constant vigilance. He has seen many companies having a lot of tools for constant vigilance but unfortunately most of them due to a lack of basic knowledge in cybersecurity miss on using those tools to their right potential. Hence there is a need for constant vigilance but need to have the right strategy in place for the effective use of it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The key achievements of John Prakash Jha’s entrepreneurial journey</h3><p>– Top 10 most promising Enterprise Information Security Provider, CIO Review.<br>– Business Excellence Award, Houston, TX</p><p>– Certified for Quality in Business, International Trade Council.</p><p>– OWASP Certified Partner</p><p>– SendQuick Certified Partner</p><p>– Winner, India 500 CEO Awards.</p><p>Started operations in:</p><ul><li>India</li><li>USA</li><li>Canada</li><li>Israel</li><li>UAE (2021)</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLumwNKamqFlmqS1r3nPq5ikmaOdequ0wGaZrquZo7K0v4ylnJqclac%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html&text=Netsach%20%7c%20John%20Prakash%20Jha&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html&title=Netsach%20%7c%20John%20Prakash%20Jha" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html&title=Netsach%20%7c%20John%20Prakash%20Jha" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html&title=Netsach%20%7c%20John%20Prakash%20Jha" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnetsach-john-prakash-jha-business-leader.html&description=Netsach%20%7c%20John%20Prakash%20Jha" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./white-shimmer-nails-7185525.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="White Shimmer Nails Are Everywhere  Here's How to Get the Look">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-fix-the-android-google-keeps-stopping-error.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Fix the Android &amp;quot;Google Keeps Stopping&amp;quot; Error">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
