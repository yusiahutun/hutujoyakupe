A story about greed, family, passion and murder, Ridley Scott’s movie focuses on the real-life story of Patrizia Reggiani, an Italian socialite played by Lady Gaga, who married Gucci heir Maurizio Gucci, portrayed by Adam Driver. Initially, they were happy together, using their soaring wealth to buy houses around the world, a super yacht and even a chauffeur-driven car with the personalised registration plate ‘Maurizia’. Patrizia herself developed a taste for luxury fashion, oscillating between head-to-toe Chanel and Gucci. She famously said, “I would rather weep in a Rolls Royce than be unhappy on a bicycle.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Maurizio was forced out of the company, then he was killed and his wife arrested for his murder<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, their relationship went south and the couple split up. In 1991, Maurizio Gucci filed for divorce and started dating another woman. He also sold his remaining stake in the Gucci brand. Patrizia flew into a rage, worried about what her ex’s new relationship and mad spending would mean for her alimony. So, she hired a hitman and had Maurizio fatally shot. Her crime didn’t go unpunished – she was sent to prison for 29 years (serving 18 for good behaviour). She still claims innocence, alleging that her clairvoyant arranged Maurizio’s murder for her as a gift, but that’s not to say she shows much remorse for what happened. Not long after her prison release, she was asked by a reporter why she hadn’t killed her ex-husband herself. “My eyesight is not so good,” she replied. “I didn’t want to miss.” It's reported that Lady Gaga stayed in character for 18 months, as she learnt to perfect Patrizia’s Italian accent and mannerisms.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for House of Gucci trailer features Lady Gaga's movie comeback (MGM)" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/house-of-gucci-trailer-1627606774.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not hard to see why Ridley Scott and his star cast, which also includes Adam Driver, Al Pacino and Salma Hayek, were drawn to the scandal. The director was inspired, however, by Sara Gay Forden’s meticulously researched book, House of Gucci, which documents – not just the murder of Maurizio – but also the Succession-style feuding of the Gucci family. One board meeting famously ended with bloodshed after an argument turned violent, while another bitter fight resulted in one of the cousins betraying his own father to the IRS, causing his eventual imprisonment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No one knows the story better than Forden, who was working in Milan as a seasoned fashion business reporter when Maurizio was murdered on 27 March 1985. In addition to already having met and interviewed the Gucci businessman and Patrizia, she spoke to more than 100 people close to the family over the course of 18 months to create an accurate and detailed account of what really happened. She was brought in to collaborate on the screenplay, which she describes as “a dream come true”, and is soon to release a movie tie-in version of her original tome. We talked to her to find out how she wrote a book that inspired a blockbuster movie, why she thinks Patrizia was moved to murder, and what drove the Guccis to ruthlessly turn on one another.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What drew you to the Gucci dynasty?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have always wanted to write a book. I’m a journalist and I deal in facts, so I knew it would be non-fiction – I just didn’t have a feel for what it would be about. One day I was in a public library doing some research and I typed in 'Gucci'. Of the 10 links that appeared, eight had been written by me and that’s when a lightbulb went off in my head. It was such a sad story – Maurizio was forced out of the company, then he was killed and his wife arrested for his murder – and I didn’t have the heart to write about it. I felt there was more of a narrative shape when the company started taking off again and I realised I could tell the story of a rise and fall and then a rise again. Although Maurizio wasn’t there to see it happen, he had been the one with the vision; he’d changed the game – the connector to the past and future."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Who was the most helpful in understanding the story?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One of the most helpful was Domenico de Sole, who had the longest arc of experience with the narrative. He started as Rodolfo Gucci’s lawyer when the family battles were starting. He was in all the family board meetings, even the more famous ones, including the time that Paolo Gucci - the grandson of the Gucci founder - was injured by another family member after being hit with tape recorder. Domenico ended up becoming the luxury CEO who turns Gucci around and takes it into the future as a multi-brand group. I also spoke a lot with Dawn Mello and Tom Ford."</p><img alt="house of gucci" title="Lady Gaga" width=2400 height=1003 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/e7j-gr-viaeeoij-1636217982.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Lady Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani in the forthcoming film</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Although a lot of the protagonists were dead – or, in Patrizia’s case, in jail and not permitted to talk to me – I was able to get very close to them through other people. I became very close to Maurizio’s secretary, who also went on to work for Patrizia and the girls. His driver, Luigi, was very helpful and someone who was with him all the time. As a good journalist, you learn that it’s the little people – the hidden or the quieter people – who are actually the most important sources."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Why did the Guccis become so cutthroat towards one another?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a case where blood was not thicker than water. There were high stakes and, ultimately, ambition and greed drove them apart rather than bringing them together. There were repeated betrayals among the family that completely eroded any trust and ability to work together towards a common goal."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">You were in Milan the day Maurizio was murdered – what are your recollections?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was so shocking. It was early, around 8.30am, and I was leaving my apartment to go to work when one of my reporters called and said, ‘Sarah, Maurizio Gucci’s been shot.’ I ran to our bureau which was round the corner from the crime scene – when I got there it had already been cordoned off, there were police officers everywhere. The place was swarming, so I couldn’t get close to it. There was a very sinister sense of the unknown because no one knew who could have done such a thing. No one knew until two years later that it was Patrizia. The magistrate investigating the murder was looking into business deals, so there was a sense that it was a Mafia or gambling debt that had turned ugly. It wasn’t evident that it was a crime of passion."</p><img alt="house of gucci" title="House of Gucci" width=4096 height=2730 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fddcx7cviam9fa-1636218896.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Adam Driver, Jared Leto and Lady Gaga in House of Gucci</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Why do you think it took two years to arrest Patrizia, especially given that she told numerous people that she wanted Maurizio dead?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The investigating magistrate fancied himself an investigator of economic and financial crimes, so that’s where his mind was. They were tapping Patrizia’s phone, but she and Pina [her clairvoyant who was also charged with arranging his murder] were talking in code about the money that she still owed the killers. There were talking about refurnishing the apartment and meters of fabric as a metaphor for the lira owed, so investigators didn’t pick it up."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Having met Patrizia, how would you describe her as a person?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She was the most complex out of the two of them. Maurizio was compelling to me because of his role in the family, but Patrizia was such a combination of different things. I do believe that she loved him in the early years and that they were happy together, but the unravelling of their relationship and her growing obsessive hatred of him that could drive her to do such a final thing was, I don’t want to say intriguing, but it’s difficult to understand. I wanted to be careful in the way I portrayed her in the book because although they called her the Black Widow in the press, she was – as the Italians would say – ‘chiara e scuro’ – the light and dark.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Patrizia was – as the Italians would say – ‘chiara e scuro’ – the light and dark<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She was very much a creature of her upbringing. She was born out of wedlock to her mother in central Italy and the mother was very socially ambitious and ended up marrying a wealthy man, but he wasn’t part of the Milanese industrial elite. She pushed Patrizia not only to marry well, but to marry a big name. Patrizia was very clever, sharp witted, funny and also very protective of her daughters. During the trial, the court ordered an in-depth psychological evaluation of her and she was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. When someone has that kind of psychology, everything that happens is felt as a blow against them personally, so for Patrizia – who was so invested in the Gucci name and company – when Maurizio lost control, she experienced that as something he had done against her. She took his struggles personally, and that cemented her anger and rage. There are people who said she was evil, but I don’t think she was – it's more complex."</p><img alt="mandatory credit photo by ipashutterstock 1023426d patrizia reggiani in the 80s retrospective of murdered fashion designer maurizio gucci, italy part of the gucci fashion dynasty, maurizio, grandson of founder guccio gucci, is credited with turning round the fashion houses fortunes in the 1980s he was gunned down in front of his milan apartment in 1995 just as he was about to re establish the brand, by debuting a line by newcomer designer tom ford his death also came at the height of the gucci family business when the dynasty was selling 500 million in fashion products a year it was later discovered that his murder was part of a plot executed by his ex wife, patrizia reggiani dubbed the black widow by italian press, reggiani is currently serving a 29 year jail sentence in milan she was found guilty of hiring a hitman to kill her husband in the hopes of gaining control of the multi million gucci empire" title="Patrizia Reggiani in the 80s" width=2008 height=2953 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/patrizia-reggiani-gucci-1615543400.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ipa/Shutterstock</span><p>Patrizia Reggiani in the ’80s</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Why do you think she did what she did?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think she did it in part to protect her daughters. She could see Maurizio was spending money in a way that was out of control and she was afraid that once he’d sold his stake, that money was finite and it would dry up. The judge summed it up really well when he issued her sentence. He described how invested Patrizia was in the name and being part of the Gucci empire; he said that Maurizio died not for who he was, but what he had."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">After having researched her extensively, what surprised you the most about Patrizia?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In subsequent interviews after prison, she described a certain nostalgia for her time in jail. I thought that was interesting; here was a woman who had lived in the heights of luxury, but she was very much alone – she was an outsider in that Milanese elite society. She had her mother who was always critical of her. She felt some humanity in jail that maybe she hadn’t had in her former life."</p><img alt="mandatory credit photo by olycom spashutterstock 3870917b patrizia reggiani out and about with her pet parrot, bo patrizia reggiani out and about in milan, italy 27 jun 2014" title="Patrizia Reggiani in 2014" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/patrizia-reggiani-milan-1615544679.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Olycom Spa/Shutterstock</span><p>Patrizia Reggiani in 2014 with her pet macaw</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Do you know much about Patrizia’s situation now?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She lives in Milan behind the courthouse where she was convicted in her late mother’s house.

I consulted on the screenplay which was a wonderful experience and it captures the spirit of the story. I’m over the moon, I couldn’t have dreamt it. The casting is phenomenal.

We’re in such difficult times, and to me this is an epic family story that shows the tragedy of not trying to work together and allowing greed to take over. It’s a warning about not remaining grounded. But to me, it’s not just about the murder, but also a story about Italian fashion, the craftsmanship and dedication to quality and making things special. In this era of everything being fast, it shows the importance of slowing down and appreciating the good things we have."</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How has Gucci managed to overcome its tragic past to become a powerhouse?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There’s this mystique about Gucci even today, something inexplicable about it. Everything has come together – when I interviewed Maurizio he refused to talk about the past because he was so embarrassed by the family fights that wanted to put a lid on it, but his PR woman used to say, ‘Maurizio you can’t pretend the past didn’t happen, you have to find a way to deal with it.’ Now, you have this Gucci that has reconnected to its past; Alessandro Michele references the icons, the GGs, the bags, the riding imagery and even the Savoy where founder Guccio Gucci worked as bell boy, while keeping it in the popular zeitgeist. It's refreshed, renewed and so cool. Young people love it, the movie is coming out so people will know about the story behind the brand told in a dramatic, compelling way, and it’s the 100th anniversary.
