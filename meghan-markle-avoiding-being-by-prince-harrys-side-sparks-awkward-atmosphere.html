He’s expected to attend the WellChild <a href=#>award show</a> ceremony. It takes place on the eve of the first anniversary of his grandmother’s death – <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><p>Harry and Meghan pulled out of the event last year as he flew up to Scotland to see his grandmother. It was claimed at the time, Meghan “wasn’t invited” to travel up there to see the family. Although, the Princess of Wales was also absent, as the Prince of Wales arrived alone.</p><p>It comes after reports the <a href=#>Sussexes were ‘snubbed’</a> with The Firm’s plans to mark the first year of the late Queen’s passing. Sources claimed neither Harry nor Meghan have been invited to take part in an event or memorial to honor the former monarch.</p><p>Official plans of what may take place as the tragic day looms have not been released. But royal sources say William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> will lead the tribute to his grandmother. <a href=#>King Charles will follow in his mother’s footsteps</a> by spending the anniversary privately. He and Queen Consort Camilla are believed to travel up to the royal residence in Balmoral.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duke-without-the-duchess-by-his-side>The Duke without the Duchess by his side</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1258508855-1024x690.jpg><p>This year alone, we’ve seen Harry jet set back to England multiple times. He ventured back for <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ Coronation back in May, with reports stating Meghan was invited to the grand event. The Duke attended his father’s special day on his lonesome next to his cousins with their partners. He was sat in the third row at Westminster Abbey with other non-working royals.</p><p>Next, she stayed at home when the prince returned to London to testify against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in a civil case. The emotional testimony saw him take it on without Meghan supporting him in person.</p><p>The couple both skipped the Trooping The Colour this year. The day marks the monarch’s birthday – the King has two each year.</p><p>Now, the 42-year-old won’t be joining her husband as he makes his next stop in the UK. But she is said to be <a href=#>flying to Düsseldorf to attend the Invictus Games</a> days later. With Meghan Markle’s support by Prince Harry’s side, the atmosphere at the event – which is close to the Duke’s heart – will likely be different from other trips.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-forced-to-ask-permission-after-eviction-from-frogmore-cottage>Forced to ‘ask permission’ after eviction from Frogmore Cottage</h2><p>When Harry does return, he’ll need somewhere to stay. It’s likely he’ll have to ask permission from Buckingham Palace to stay in one of the royal residences. Or, he can bunk up with one of his cousins, as he has done in the past. The last option is whether he’ll decide to seek private accommodation himself.</p><p>Mr Nanan-Sen adds: “Whatever option Prince Harry chooses to pursue, he will likely feel far more isolated than if Meghan was by his side.”</p><p>Meghan and Harry no longer have a permanent home in England. The pair were evicted from Frogmore Cottage officially earlier this year. Since, they have set up their paradise in California, which even has a <a href=#>special area dedicated to little Lilibet</a>.</p><p>They were forced to hand over the keys to the home based in Windsor. The residence hasn’t been officially given to another royal. However, it’s believed Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank have permanently made the move.</p><p>The couple were gifted Frogmore Cottage in 2019, a year after they said their vows. They paid for an extensive renovation independently after the generous gift from the Queen.</p><p>But time in the happy estate was short-lived. By the end of the year, that had set off to Canada. In early 2020 announced they were stepping down as senior members of the royal family.</p><p>It’s believed the pair were asked to remove remaining possessions in the stunning home in 2023. It came weeks after Harry’s bombshell memoir Spare was released in January.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2eDcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmq6fnrGqusZmmZ6hnpx6o8WMqamippOaeqmt0auwrGWjnrGmedKpmKujo2KuuLfWmqmdZZGpurC%2Fz6Gcq51f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html&text=Meghan%20Markle%20%27avoiding%27%20being%20by%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20side%20sparks%20%27awkward%20atmosphere%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20%27avoiding%27%20being%20by%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20side%20sparks%20%27awkward%20atmosphere%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20%27avoiding%27%20being%20by%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20side%20sparks%20%27awkward%20atmosphere%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20%27avoiding%27%20being%20by%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20side%20sparks%20%27awkward%20atmosphere%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markle-avoiding-being-by-prince-harrys-side-sparks-awkward-atmosphere.html&description=Meghan%20Markle%20%27avoiding%27%20being%20by%20Prince%20Harry%27s%20side%20sparks%20%27awkward%20atmosphere%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./489501-what-happened-lil-mama-latest-updates-rapper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Lil Mama?
