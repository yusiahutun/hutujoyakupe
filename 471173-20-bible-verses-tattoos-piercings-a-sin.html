Therefore, you might want to think beyond your <a href=#>religious beliefs</a>. However, if you are a Christian, you are already aware of its stigma, with <a href=#>various Bible verses</a> discussing it in a bad light. So, are there Bible verses about tattoos in the New Testament?</p><ul><li>You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the Lord. - Leviticus 19:28</li><li>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20</li><li>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. - 1 Corinthians 10:31</li><li>And try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. - Ephesians 5:10</li><li>You are the sons of the Lord your God. You shall not cut yourselves or make any baldness on your foreheads for the dead. - Deuteronomy 14:1</li><li>All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. - 1 Corinthians 10:23</li><li>Therefore, God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonouring of their bodies among themselves - Romans 1:24</li><li>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, ... - 2 Corinthians 3:3-9</li><li>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. - 2 Corinthians 5:10</li><li>Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. - Romans 6:13</li><li>Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewellery, or the clothing you wear— but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. - 1 Peter 3:3-4</li><li>Do you not know that you are God's temple and God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple. - 1 Corinthians 3:16-17</li><li>But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others, I should be disqualified. - 1 Corinthians 9:27</li><li>I appeal to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. - Romans 12:1</li><li>Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. - 1 Corinthians 6:18</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79fef1a2cb93b996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ Zulu proverbs and sayings about love, life, and death</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors!

The book's primary purpose was to strengthen the faith of members of the churches by providing them with the assurance of deliverance from evil. The book has some interesting scriptures on tattooing that you will find quite informative.</p><ul><li>On his robe and his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. - Revelation 19:16</li><li>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it, the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority. One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marvelled as they followed the beast. And they worshipped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?" And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two. - Revelation 13:1-18</li><li>That Jesus has a tattoo on His thigh, "And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."- Revelation 19:16</li><li>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name is written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords. - Revelation 19:16</li><li>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. - Revelation 13:16</li><li>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worships the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image. Whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. - Revelation 14:9-11</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdd85cfbb99d2044.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Prayer for enemies to leave me alone</span></p></a><h2>Did the disciples have tattoos?</h2><p class=align-left>It is not clear whether the disciples had tattoos from the scriptures. People have also misinterpreted the Bible to indicate that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jesus had a tattoo</a> on his thigh. Even though the Old Testament speaks of physical signs, nothing in the scriptures states that Jesus was tattooed or his disciples.</p><h2>Is getting a tattoo a sin in the Bible?</h2><p class=align-left>It is one of the most controversial questions for Christians, but the bottom line is that it depends on how you interpret the scripture.</p><p class=align-left>Many verses in the Bible talk against tattooing. The most significant one is Leviticus 19:28, which states, "Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you." It is a Hebrew prohibition that makes Christians have taken to heart.</p><p class=align-left>Bible verses about tattoos mention various things about the old tradition that communities have practised for ages. One thing is clear – the Bible doesn't talk about it in good light. However, people have argued that the perception of tattoos differed from now. So, you must figure out what ideologies you will settle on before getting inked.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7222f56bbfd3a256.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing badass quotes for men</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you looking for the best tattoo ideas? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an <a href=#>informative article </a>providing a list of beautiful butterfly hand tattoo ideas for girls with meanings.</p><p class=align-left>Butterflies are a popular choice for ladies as they represent freedom, change, and transformation.
