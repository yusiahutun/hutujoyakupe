One of her former pipers has revealed the sweet gesture the Queen</strong></p><p>A year after the <a href=#>Queen</a>‘s passing, royal author Omid Scobie’s new book Endgame reveals how the late monarch had her unique ways of treating her staff. She made time for people who worked with her, especially the ones who had been with her for a number of years.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1324680535-784x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-queen-s-piper-recalls-cheerful-banter-with-her-majesty>Queen’s piper recalls ‘cheerful banter with Her Majesty’</h2><p>Author <a href=#>Omid Scobie</a> reveals the Queen had a surprisingly nice and friendly rapport with her pipers. This included ‘cheerful banter’ and even one-liners from the former monarch.</p><p>The author recounts Scott Methven’s experience, a piper who served the Queen from 2015 to 2019. He also stated how the monarch chose to break the ice with him.</p><p>“Do you know you’re the first piper to hold the post that I haven’t had to look up to?” she once joked to Methven, who – though broad in stature – stands at just five six.</p><p>“That was the first thing she said to me,” he later shared. “So, I was like, ‘Right, is that how it’s going to be?! One-liners.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1243354836-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-epitome-of-kindness>Epitome of ‘kindness’</h2><p>The Queen not only shared jokes with her pipers but also showed utmost kindness and respect. Scobie revealed her generosity went beyond just helping her staff but also their family members.</p><p>When the piper’s wife, Morven, was diagnosed with cancer, the monarch became a pillar of support for him, asking him to go home and be with his wife.</p><p>“You’re not playing. You’re going to go to the hospital now and sit with your wife.” the Queen had told him. Gushing over her genuine kindness, the piper shared: “She treats everyone with the utmost respect.”</p><p>The Queen also made sure the piper’s position remained safe. While his wife was undergoing chemotherapy treatment, the British Army wanted to install a new pipe major who didn’t have family matters to attend to. But the Queen stood by and supported him.</p><p>“I’ve got one Queen’s Piper. And the reason he isn’t here is that he’s away caring for his wife,” she instructed her staff.</p><p>She reportedly added: “So, you are not replacing him under any circumstances. He is not getting removed from his post because his wife is dying of cancer.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WDcMDHnmSqrZWau26%2FwK%2BcnWWYmr9uvMipnKurXZ%2B8o3nWoZynZZiewG7DyJ%2BcZq%2BRqHqlxcinnmanlmKworrCnqlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html&text=The%20Queen%20%27saved%27%20her%20piper%27s%20job%20when%20his%20wife%20was%20dying%20of%20cancer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html&title=The%20Queen%20%27saved%27%20her%20piper%27s%20job%20when%20his%20wife%20was%20dying%20of%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html&title=The%20Queen%20%27saved%27%20her%20piper%27s%20job%20when%20his%20wife%20was%20dying%20of%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html&title=The%20Queen%20%27saved%27%20her%20piper%27s%20job%20when%20his%20wife%20was%20dying%20of%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-queen-saved-her-pipers-job-when-his-wife-was-dying-of-cancer.html&description=The%20Queen%20%27saved%27%20her%20piper%27s%20job%20when%20his%20wife%20was%20dying%20of%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dolly-parton-lainey-wilson-i-will-always-love-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Dolly Parton + Lainey Wilson Sing 'I Will Always Love You'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./racecard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Race Cards | HK Racing">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
