In mid-March, entertainment venues, including bars, were ordered to shut, though some remained open by serving food, a loophole that allowed drinking dens to stay afloat. Although the area was reopened in June, there has been little sign of recovery on a strip that only eight months ago was abuzz with the hedonism for which it became notorious during the 2010s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pandemic has exposed Siem Reap’s over-reliance on the tourist dollar. The hospitality industry’s sudden breakdown has seen thousands of workers lose their jobs in one of the kingdom’s poorest provinces. But Pub Street is also falling victim to another development; one that has been in the making for longer than just a few months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/ef2ea4aa-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2007, when I first visited the newly coined Pub Street – then just one road, Street 8, rather than the conglomeration of laneways that the name now connotes – I perched outside The Red Piano on a Saturday night, on a dust road devoid of traffic or crowds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Revisiting the city in subsequent years revealed stylish new bars on intriguing alleyways – the chinoiserie-themed Miss Wong, Siem Reap’s most revered cocktail haunt, opened in 2008; the lively Picasso Bar was unveiled in 2009 – but unchecked development led to overcrowding and the unfussy homogenisation of Pub Street. Its commercial success spilled over to thoroughfares such as Sok San Road, with its assortment of louche locales frequented by men of a certain age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the mid-2010s, Pub Street had become, like Bangkok’s Patpong, a melange of booze, beer pong and dubious massages. At the roadside, gaudy pop-up cocktail stalls flourished, their owners paying off the police to remain in operation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/f6af1002-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pub Street’s expansion mirrored Siem Reap’s own transformation, from a low-key destination beloved by middle-aged travellers to a bustling city targeted by young backpackers. The degradation of the strip was evident to anyone wandering the area in daylight, though. Slapdash building design and a lack of long-term vision had resulted in an ungainly architectural hodgepodge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a look that reflected the no-frills ethos of this noisy party zone, with its fishy foot massages, booze-party cyclos, tarantula snacks and one-dollar beers. Dancers revelling bare-chested outside nightclubs completed the scene.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“About four years ago, shops were popping up without paying any rent,” says Saryroth Chan, head of dining-excursion company DineBeyond. “They played very loud music, just bombing each other. You couldn’t run a business around there. They should have been asking for proper permission from the tourism ministry so that we could all run a proper business.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinatown in Perth offers taste of an Asia that’s out of bounds</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Miss Wong decamped south of the Siem Reap River last month, it was hard not to see its relocation as a metaphor for the deterioration of Pub Street. It also affirmed what residents have known for years: the area surrounding Wat Bo Road, with its galleries, boutique hotels and hip restaurants, has become the city’s new capital of cosmopolitan cool.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Pub Street’s future might appear bleak, characterful venues doing their best to keep the scene vibrant can be found hidden in the two alleys that run parallel to the main drag: The Lane and Alley West, to the north and south, respectively. All are struggling to survive Covid-19 but some are at least able to draw a Friday night crowd from Siem Reap’s foreign residents, who have always preferred these hideaways to touristy Pub Street. Cambodian revellers are a rarer sight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/e132971c-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alley West, with its artisanal ice cream parlours, chic boutiques and colourful umbrellas suspended over the pavement, is seeing a mini-renaissance thanks to Bar 43, a glamorous bolt-hole that opened in June. The bar’s Hawaiian-shirt-wearing owner, Amine Stambouli, hails from Paris but has lived in Cambodia for 10 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With a friend, also called Amine, Stambouli infused the space with a stylish design, tiki-style drink presentation and a good-humoured vibe (being opposite the Picasso Bar doesn’t hurt). The bar is striking even from the outside, with its vivid royal blue facade and porthole-style windows, but inside a wraparound leather sofa, extravagant drinks cabinet and avant-garde lighting exude an ambience that’s rare in the wider Siem Reap, let alone Pub Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/e6fe265c-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Menaka Lounge, meanwhile – located near the Old Market, its “secret” entrance in a dimly lit alleyway – is an establishment that in any major city would be a roaring success. Its scarlet interior, a love letter to Cambodia lavishly decked out with iconography from the kingdom, sets the scene for intimate gatherings for its small, but loyal, clientele, who sup cocktails designed to represent the country’s history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Lane is home to businesses of an older vintage, and despite Miss Wong’s departure, the mood remains upbeat. Asana, with its charming wait staff, is a traditional wooden house with stuffed rice sacks for seats and cocktails served in teapots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/e456855c-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Nobushi, a bohemian Japanese izakaya that moved here in May last year, chef-server Yuichiro Hamasaki – a blues aficionado – doesn’t seem remotely worried about the drop in custom. With smiling eyes and a friendly demeanour, he’s more than happy to treat occasional guests to music videos on a large TV screen while his enormous retriever sits patiently waiting for walkies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the small hours, the tranquillity along The Lane is shattered by the music emanating from Silk Garden. This casual haunt, sandwiched between Asana and Nobushi, doesn’t come with grand pretensions but its open-air layout, theme nights and seclusion have made it a popular party bar during the pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/14/f2f5076e-dc51-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_164950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s at Silk Garden that a motley group of coronavirus refugees – stuck-in-transit travellers and resident foreigners – congregate in these uncertain, dislocated times. For if this really is the end – of travel, of our life plans, of Pub Street itself – then this back-alley bar is as convivial a venue as any in which to mark the occasion.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: The temples of gloom</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlwcGtoaXyztdKeZJqmlGKzorjLZpqapZKksaqt0manrppdqMGzscStZKano6l6r7vTqKmip6WoerGt0a2w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html&text=The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20Cambodias%20Pub%20Street%2c%20the%20most%20notorious%20party%20strip%20in%20the%20country&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html&title=The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20Cambodias%20Pub%20Street%2c%20the%20most%20notorious%20party%20strip%20in%20the%20country" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html&title=The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20Cambodias%20Pub%20Street%2c%20the%20most%20notorious%20party%20strip%20in%20the%20country" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html&title=The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20Cambodias%20Pub%20Street%2c%20the%20most%20notorious%20party%20strip%20in%20the%20country" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frise-and-fall-cambodias-pub-street-most-notorious-party.html&description=The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20Cambodias%20Pub%20Street%2c%20the%20most%20notorious%20party%20strip%20in%20the%20country" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./511172-viral-photo-25-helicopters-captured-prestigious-st-andrews-school-turi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Viral Photo of Over 25 Helicopters Was Not Captured at Prestigious St Andrews School, Turi">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./supreme-teases-collaboration-luggage-brand-giant-rimowa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Supreme teases collaboration with luggage-brand giant Rimowa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
