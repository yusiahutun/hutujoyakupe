The corrections officers looked at me differently. Inmates wanted my autograph; others asked me for money, assuming being on television means you're rich," she wrote in the book. "I still have no frame of reference or context for what led the general viewing public to their hype, because I have never seen The Act. I was not consulted or compensated for a show that made actor Joey King a household name."</p><p>She said she has not watched the show in full and has only seen a short clip which was played during an award show. "It was so far removed from my reality, it was hard to be sure what I was looking at," she recalled.</p><p>"I just remember seeing Joey glammed out on the red carpet, the stark contrast of our lives casting a dark shadow over me," she continued. "Here I was in my prison cell wearing my prison uniform, eating my disgusting prison food, while Hollywood celebrated itself. All I could think was, This girl tried to play me, and I had no control over it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e0fa132a-77b0-4677-911b-9691b9841af9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1348a000-9274-459e-a679-22a0d7bfc420 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/5by4/2024/01/08/8537def83ac84a22b8c596a0cf46e774_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gypsy Rose Blanchard Details First Time Having Sex with Husband After Saying 'the D Is Fire'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Blanchard said when she found out about the series from her stepmom, she was confused as to how anyone could make the show "without even talking to me about it first and asking me one-on-one questions." She added she was "upset" and had zero participation with the series, claiming, "No one asked me if it was okay that they made this about my life."</p><p>According to Gypsy Rose, she was "happy" they didn't get Hulu behind bars, so nobody there could watch the show and make assumptions about her. She explained that after the series began airing, "it was like a bomb went off" and she became "a celebrity overnight ... for doing something horrible" -- claiming its release also affected her parents, with "strange women" with "no boundaries" reaching out to her father as well.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d4eacf32-11e5-4af7-a73d-34720af8afa9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1348a000-9274-459e-a679-22a0d7bfc420 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6e/5by4/2024/01/04/6e3fcb26eb0f4e6caee76babbbf47993_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram/AP</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gypsy Rose Details Most Recent Contact with Mom's Killer Nick Godejohn While Behind Bars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The biggest way its release affected her, however, was when it came to her love life. At the time, she was dating and became engaged to a man named Ken.</p><p>"The intrusion into my private life -- a private life that I am trying damn hard to build for myself -- has been the worst part of the aftermath of The Act," she shared, saying the publicity "scared him off."</p><p>"My personal life became public, which was really hard on Ken. Clickbait articles appeared mockingly announcing our engagement. Ken was a private person and didn't want the attention or the scrutiny," she wrote. "While I understood and shared in his sentiment, I took it hard when he ended our relationship. My first experience with real heartbreak -- I didn't know what to do."</p><p>She later explained in the book that she knows some will "criticize" her for working on two books, her Lifetime series and a followup show for the network -- but said she never sought out fame or publicity. "Blessings like this found me," she added.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom is available now.</a></p><a id=gallery-link-9049b3c4-dcc4-4aad-aec6-28230c70afa1 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9049b3c4-dcc4-4aad-aec6-28230c70afa1 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:1348a000-9274-459e-a679-22a0d7bfc420 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ba/4by3/2024/01/01/bac1c55018d540e6af961288b38a7cfb_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaXFfnMaxv9hmqairlWKvra3NnJ%2BaqpRiwK2tzKxkraCVYq6kwI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html&text=Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%20Criticizes%20The%20Act%2c%20Reveals%20How%20Show%20Affected%20Her%20In%20Prison&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html&title=Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%20Criticizes%20The%20Act%2c%20Reveals%20How%20Show%20Affected%20Her%20In%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html&title=Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%20Criticizes%20The%20Act%2c%20Reveals%20How%20Show%20Affected%20Her%20In%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html&title=Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%20Criticizes%20The%20Act%2c%20Reveals%20How%20Show%20Affected%20Her%20In%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgypsy-rose-blanchard-slams-the-act.html&description=Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%20Criticizes%20The%20Act%2c%20Reveals%20How%20Show%20Affected%20Her%20In%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./patricia-hodge-and-peter-douglas-owen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patricia Hodge and Peter Douglas Owen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./big-brother-newcomer-faridas-tv-31138830.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Brother newcomer Farida's TV past exposed by fans minutes after ITV show debut">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
