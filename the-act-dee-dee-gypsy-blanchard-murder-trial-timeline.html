Friends and neighbors knew Gypsy as a sickly, wheelchair-bound child, and Dee Dee as her devoted caregiver, but after Dee Dee’s death the truth emerged: Gypsy was perfectly healthy, but had been forced to pretend otherwise by her mother. Over the first twenty years of her life, Gypsy was subjected to a battery of unnecessary medical procedures, forced to use a wheelchair and feeding tube, and denied any semblance of a normal life: She didn’t attend school past second grade, and never left the house without her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2016 BuzzFeed article" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2016 BuzzFeed article</a> detailing the extraordinary case, Michelle Dean—who now serves as co-showrunner and executive producer on The Act—noted that Dee Dee’s behavior was indicative of Munchausen by Proxy syndrome (a variation on Munchausen syndrome, whereby a person feigns or induces symptoms of illness in themselves). After two decades of being abused and effectively held prisoner, Gypsy came up with an escape plan, enlisting her boyfriend Nick Godejohn to murder Dee Dee.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">The Act</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Watch Now for The Act" data-href=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-product-url=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Now" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-vars-ga-product-brand=lu data-vars-ga-product-id=99b7b3a3-d420-4923-9e34-3da6df81fc5f data-vars-ga-product-price=$5.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d4dff7d0-a806-47b3-9044-847b7fcb15e7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=lu data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Act" title="The Act" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1553732405-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d.jpg width=400 height=600 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you haven’t already dived into the first four episodes of The Act (which are streaming now on Hulu) then truly, what are you waiting for?

The two moved from Slidell, Louisiana to Aurora, Missouri in September 2005, and lived in a rental home before the Habitat for Humanity house was completed. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BuzzFeed class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BuzzFeed</a>, Dee Dee claimed that their home in Louisiana had been hit by Hurricane Katrina, and their apartment destroyed. She also claimed that Gypsy’s medical records had been destroyed in the flood (this was later found not to be the case; many of her records did, in fact, survive Katrina) and that her daughter suffered from a range of chronic illnesses all stemming from “chromosomal defects," including muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, severe allergies, and asthma. At the time they moved into the house, Gypsy was wheelchair-bound and used a feeding tube and sometimes an oxygen tank.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>February 2011</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gypsy made her first, and seemingly only, escape attempt. After meeting a man (his identity was kept anonymous in Dean's Buzzfeed article) at a science fiction convention she attended with Dee Dee, Gypsy began communicating with the man online. She was 19 at the time (though she and her mother claimed she was 15) and the man was 35. He took Gypsy back to his hotel room, but Dee Dee found them and presented paperwork stating that Gypsy was a minor. In the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, Gypsy recalls Dee Dee saying, “If you ever try to do that again, I’m going to smash your fingers with a hammer.” During Godejohn’s trial, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/15/gypsy-blanchard-testifies-godejohns-murder-trial/2010754002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gypsy testified" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gypsy testified</a> that after her escape attempt, Dee Dee smashed her computer and cellphones, and chained her to her bed for two weeks.</p><img alt="Facial expression, Fun, Smile, Event, Interaction, Photography, Happy, Vacation, Performance, Family, " title="Facial expression, Fun, Smile, Event, Interaction, Photography, Happy, Vacation, Performance, Family, " width=2048 height=1365 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blancharde-greene-county-sheriff-1554308506.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Greene County Sheriff's Office</span><p>Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee Blanchard</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>2012</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During this year, per BuzzFeed, Gypsy continued to use the internet in secret after Dee Dee went to bed.

According to BuzzFeed, Gypsy told Woodmansee that she and Godejohn were planning a future together, had discussed eloping, and had sexual exchanges online that included elements of BDSM. Alarmed—in part because she still believed Gypsy to be a minor—Woodmansee reportedly tried to talk her out of continuing contact with Godejohn, but assumed that the actual plans were just a fantasy.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>March 2015</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gypsy and Godejohn came up with a plan to stage a meeting in real life in Dee Dee’s presence, hoping that Dee Dee might allow them to date if she thought they met for the first time in person. Godejohn traveled to Springfield, Missouri to meet Gypsy and Dee Dee at a movie theater, where they were going to see Disney’s Cinderella. The meeting did not go as planned—Dee Dee hated Godejohn—but Gypsy was still able to sneak away and lose her virginity to Godejohn in a bathroom stall, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/15/gypsy-blanchard-testifies-godejohns-murder-trial/2010754002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to her testimony" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">according to her testimony</a> at his trial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ABC News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ABC News</a>, Dee Dee punished Gypsy after the movie theater incident. “She got jealous, because I was spending a little too much attention on him, and she had ordered me to stay away from him,” Gypsy told 20/20. “And needless to say, that was a very long argument that lasted a couple weeks. Yelling, throwing things, calling me names: bitch, slut, whore.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was after this day, according to Gypsy, that she decided Dee Dee had to die. “It was not because I hated her.

When he got confirmation that Dee Dee was asleep, he went to the Blanchards’ house where Gypsy gave him a knife. She then went to hide in the bathroom with her hands over her ears while Godejohn stabbed Dee Dee to death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I honestly thought he would end up not doing it,” Gypsy told 20/20. “I heard her scream once, and there was more screaming but not like the kind in a horror film. Just like a startled scream, and she asked, ‘Who was it that was in the bedroom?’ And she called out to my name about three or four times, and at that point, I wanted to go help her so bad, but I was so afraid to get up. It's like my body wouldn't move. Then everything just went quiet.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Gypsy and Godejohn say they had sex in Gypsy's bed in the Blanchard house immediately following the murder, according to ABC News.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>June 14, 2015</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the murder, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/crime/gypsy-rose-blanchard-online-relationship-mom-murderer-nick-godejohn/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>, Gypsy and Godejohn stayed overnight at his motel in Springfield, before catching a bus to his home in Big Bend, Wisconsin on June 14.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That afternoon, a pair of disturbing posts appeared on Dee Dee’s Facebook page. “That Bitch is dead!” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/deegyp.blancharde/posts/10206865671021262 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="was the first message" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">was the first message</a>, leading friends and neighbors to wonder whether the account had been hacked.
