Chinese Wolf Warrior diplomats have labelled American racial discrimination a “social ill”; the People’s Daily has run cartoons of the Statue of Liberty shattering under police blows.&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How racism and discrimination affect black people in China and Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And China has accused Washington of having double standards for supporting Hong Kong protesters while cracking down on US demonstrators. “Let’s wait and see which country will encounter more chaos,” the Global Times wrote shortly after Floyd’s death.&nbsp;</p>Civil rights campaigners and members of President <a class="d8-auto-link euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Joe Biden</span></a>’s administration, hoping to reverse racial and social divisiveness under former president Donald Trump, have countered that US diversity and willingness to address racial tensions is a source of strength as the US grapples with its shortcomings.&nbsp;<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are an experiment, consistently reiterating ourselves so as to make ‘a more perfect union’,” Amanda Nguyen, founder of Rise, an Asian-American activist group, said recently on an Axios panel, quoting the US Constitution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/04/07/thumbnail_webyt_clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the wake of recent violence, African-American and Asian groups have taken steps to join forces. These include: volunteers escorting fearful elders on errands in New York and Oakland, California; Asian and black professionals raising over US$150,000 to support the Asian-American community in California; and food and clothing distribution in Manhattan’s Chinatown by activists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two groups, sometimes struggling economically in the same impoverished neighbourhoods, have a checkered history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1990s, a Korean store owner’s shooting of a 15-year-old African-American in South Central Los Angeles fuelled the destruction of dozens of Korean-American businesses a few months after police were cleared in the beating of black motorist Rodney King.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Asian-American stories that history tried to forget highlighted in new television series</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But they have worked together on civil rights causes. Political activist Yuri Kochiyama was closely involved with black empowerment groups, cradling Malcolm X’s head after his 1965 assassination; the term Asian-American was coined by Asian graduate students channeling the Black Power movement; and African-Americans in Los Angeles helped Japanese-Americans while they were detained in camps during World War II, assisting them in getting resettled once they returned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With both communities increasingly under siege – this month saw another black man shot by Minnesota police 10 miles from where Floyd died – some activists blame a view espoused by the white majority since the 1950s that Asian-Americans are hard-working and do not complain.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/06/15/thumbnail_webyt_clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:13</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Black Lives Matter protests held across Asia</p><p>Black Lives Matter protests held across Asia</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While seemingly a compliment, this view served to divide minorities, they say, even as Asians were still seen as “below” whites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This idea of the ‘model minority’ was really weaponized after the 1950s, 1960s,” said Renee Tajima-Peña, producer of the documentaries Asian Americans and Who Killed Vincent Chin?&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The idea of Asian-Americans being quiet, not protesting like African-Americans were protesting, was used as a wedge against the black movement,” added Tajima-Peña, whose mother and grandmother were detained in Japanese-American detention camps during World War II.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tajima-Pena cites a proclamation by the California legislature in the 1870s that considered four black people equal to two Asians or one white. “Those fault lines have been there until today,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No country has a monopoly on scapegoating or racism. Some note the parallel between the widespread blaming of Asian-Americans for Covid-19’s spread – fuelled by Trump’s use of “Chinese virus” and “kung flu” - and the discrimination, evictions and forced quarantines Africans faced from local officials and residents in southern China last year.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local officials in Guangdong reportedly advised businesses not to serve Africans, with images going viral of a McDonald’s sign forbidding black people from entering. BCC members, after living in China, cited widespread provincial stereotypes – all northeasterners are tough, southerners are refined – and racial prejudice by majority Han Chinese toward Chinese minorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/04/20/21346495-6f93-4b46-9675-7094d5da63a3_f67d3284.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Akpaninyie, who said he tried to get his students in Yunnan to question their preconceptions about foreigners and Chinese minorities, said a goal of the Black China Caucus was to bridge divides.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many BCC members say they had never considered a China-related career and only pursued it after being encouraged by white or Chinese mentors, given the relative scarcity of black role models.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keisha Brown, assistant history professor at Tennessee State University, an Asian studies specialist, said she had a great Chinese language teacher in her public high school who encouraged her to take a school trip to Beijing at 16. “That moment really changed it,” said Brown, a BCC co-founder.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Asian-American group reports 3,795 racially motivated attacks during pandemic</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Barros, a China analyst with the German Marshall Fund, did a homestay in Japan as a teenager and studied Japanese history. That inspired him to study Chinese in college, spend time on the mainland and attend a military academy in Taiwan.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And Hargis had several white mentors who encouraged her to study Mandarin – her art interest helped her learn characters, she said – including a former ambassador who advised her to develop expertise in both Taiwan and China.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He told me: We need black China hands who have experience on both sides of street. You want to develop skill in both China and Taiwan,” she said. “It was the best advice I got.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many say that when in China, they are initially pegged as Africans. On explaining that many Americans are black, they were then typecast as rap singers or basketball players. “Unfortunately, I’m not good at basketball. I didn’t want to play because I play soccer,” said Akpaninyie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many said they learned to navigate between what was hurtful and racist and what was more innocent curiosity, as tiresome as the endless pawing, photos and baby-holding requests could be.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several BCC members supported the idea of appointing a black US ambassador to China to help erode stereotypes – only 3.3 per cent of senior US diplomats are black – with retired US Army Lieutenant General Charles Hooper, a fluent Mandarin speaker, cited as one possibility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hargis used her “oddity” status to her advantage by studying her Mandarin on the street, leading to endless chats and free lessons from curious locals. Others reported being asked repeatedly about their hair, whether it was permed, how it got so curly. “They were fascinated,” said Brown. “It was genuine curiosity.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But other communication was less positive. China hands cite caricatures on WeChat of overweight, lazy black people and segments on the CCTV New Year’s gala of primitive sexualised figures dancing in African clothes.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How Asian-Americans are banding together to confront hate crimes</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">BCC members recall being taken aback by a 2016 Chinese detergent advertisement –portraying a housewife forcing a black man into a washing machine only to have him emerge white – and a widely sold toothpaste called “Darkie,” subsequently changed to “Darlie”, with an exaggerated graphic of a black musician.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Going to a supermarket and this was, like, literally a minstrel theme on display as a logo. What? Am I seeing this correctly?” said Akpaninyie. “I was seeing some of the sinister elements of anti-black racism and cultural attitudes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Members of the BCC, who number around 150, say that after years of attending China-related events at which they were the only black person, it has been a huge vote of confidence, source of inspiration and locus for networking to be part of a group of black China experts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They have also tried to encourage young black people to join the field, created a young professionals mentoring programme and pushed the boundaries by questioning assumptions and bringing up uncomfortable issues.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brown recalls being in a seminar about Asian and American mixed-race couples, which focused almost exclusively on white men and Asian women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she questioned this, the presenter responded that they didn’t think the audience was interested in different kinds of couples, which led to an awkward silence but she persevered.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need to critically engage and have those conversations,” she said. “I look different from everyone else. I have to own it.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brown, like many, has been horrified by the images of assaults on Asian-Americans. “You have to have sympathy, you’re just trying to go grocery shopping and someone spits on me,” she said. “It’s unfortunate that black Americans do know what that feels like, your outside looks mean they can scapegoat you.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I hope in this moment of sharing, with others doing work before, that there is activism between Asians and Africans,” Brown added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need to normalise the idea that America is diverse, not all old white men. There’s nothing wrong with old white men, but there is more out there.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyivtOimqWdX2h%2BdHyQcmton6KkxKq6xmalrqWSmr9urcWroJyZnmKurrHRopqapl2Ytaq6wGacsaiVp8G0edaoqaRll5a2r3nRnpqon56ewaq7zQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html&text=Growing%20number%20of%20African-American%20China%20experts%20work%20to%20gain%20recognition%2c%20puncture%20stereotypes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html&title=Growing%20number%20of%20African-American%20China%20experts%20work%20to%20gain%20recognition%2c%20puncture%20stereotypes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html&title=Growing%20number%20of%20African-American%20China%20experts%20work%20to%20gain%20recognition%2c%20puncture%20stereotypes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html&title=Growing%20number%20of%20African-American%20China%20experts%20work%20to%20gain%20recognition%2c%20puncture%20stereotypes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrowing-number-african-american-china-experts-work-gain-recognition.html&description=Growing%20number%20of%20African-American%20China%20experts%20work%20to%20gain%20recognition%2c%20puncture%20stereotypes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./halloween-costumes-snooki-jersey-shore-outfits-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Halloween 2010 -- Saturday Night!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./songs-about-mexico.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Best Songs About Mexico">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
