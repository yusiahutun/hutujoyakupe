Inspiring people by the way you work can also encourage them by the way you live your personal life. The same can be said about the famous and prominent American inspirational speaker, Liz Murray who has inspired a lot of people by her words and the way she handles her married life and her children. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>We also would like to address the story of the struggles she once faced back in her early life.</p><p>So without any further ado, let us get going.</p><h2>Married Life of Liz Murray With Her Husband And The Children:</h2><p>Liz has been married to her husband, James Scanlon for a long time now and the couple is also blessed with two children, a son named Liam and a daughter named Maya Jean. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has not been that vocal or open about her married life in front of the fans and media. Liz&nbsp;has also not revealed any pivotal details about her marriage and motherhood like the date of her wedding day and the time when her children were born. But once in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, she revealed how she changed as a person after getting married and having children.</p><p>My husband, James, has been my best friend and having children -- you are going to get me almost crying about it. We do this thing in this country -- maybe it is around the world -- where we talk about my kid, my kid. After you have a child, you realize it is sort of arbitrary who you are a parent to. You sort of look at other kids and feel responsible for them, too.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She then added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>I wish we could collectively say, "These are all our children." I feel responsible to make the world better for all our children. I guess if there is a big spiritual experience in my life, it is me becoming a mother.</p><p>Good to know that she has a wonderful and pleasant relationship with her husband and her adorable&nbsp;children.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>The Struggles And Stumbles She Faced In Her Life!</h2><p>Liz struggled with her family while she was a kid.</p><p>Her father was a drug addict while her mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict as well. Both of her parents died of AIDS. After her mother, Jean Murray&nbsp;died from complications of HIV-AIDS, she and her HIV-infected father Peter Finnerty&nbsp;became homeless. She did not attend school until the 8th grade, and even after she joined, she had very poor grades due to poor attendance&nbsp;but was accepted by the Humanities Preparatory School in Greenwich Village, where the teachers&nbsp;cared about her welfare. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She was living on the streets, doing&nbsp;homework in subway stations and eating from the&nbsp;dumpsters. Still, Liz managed to complete her high school in two years. She also received a New York Times scholarship for needy students at Harvard University&nbsp;and&nbsp;began her classes&nbsp;in 2000. Liz has also discussed her struggles and&nbsp;pain in her best-selling memoir, "Breaking Night."&nbsp;</p><p>Born in the Bronx, Murray watched her parents mainlining a heavy amount of coke all day. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled it</a> by saying, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Both my parents were hippies. By the time the early 1980s came around and I'd been born, their disco dancing thing had become a drug habit,"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>in 2014, when she was asked if she&nbsp;ever experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, she replied,</p><p>I've never been asked that before. You know, I happen to be a psych graduate student so I know a bit about PTSD. I would say knowing those symptoms, the majority and range of them, no. But the one symptom that comes with PTSD that people have are intrusive thoughts where you will suddenly remember something and it is not the most pleasant memory. I have had that come up in the past but not too much in the last few years.</p><p>She then continued,</p><p>I know they also talk about nightmares with PTSD. When you're young and you're homeless and your mother is not even HIV anymore -- she has full-blown AIDS -- you are kind of directionless. You wish you could make it better. You wish you could do something and then she passed away. I remember the few years after she passed, I would dream of her quite a bit. It was always these dreams where I wanted to save her and was unable to. I think people are, in general, more resilient than we realize. You don't know how strong you are until you have to be strong.</p><p>Also, when she was asked what enabled her to come out of that time, that dark phase unscathed, she responded, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There are two things I will say about that. First of all, how do we measure a life? I happened to do something that was visible and fits in really well with accomplishments in our country. But I think there are many other ways.Every week, I volunteer at Covenant House in New York City. We work with homeless youth ages 18-21. They share their stories with me and I am talking about abuse, neglect, death of family members -- things that are horrendous. And I see resilience in their joy and I see resilience in their choice to trust people and to be kind.</p><p>She then elaborated further,</p><p>But to answer your question more specifically, how do you get out of homelessness into Harvard? You have no idea how many people helped me. I did do the homework and fill out the applications but I did it in context. That context was this wonderful alternative high school called Humanities Preparatory Academy in Manhattan. I walked in there shortly after I buried my mother. I was 17 and living on the streets. I had the education of technically an eighth-grader, but in reality I had never had a formal education.</p><p>When I walked in, it felt like walking out of a storm onto somebody's doorstep and asking for shelter. It wasn't just all a pity party. It was: "What do you want to do with your life? Let's build that skill set. What are your dreams? Let's make your dreams come true."</p><p>Furthermore, when she was asked how she found the derivation, she answered,</p><p>As I kid, I saw the contradictions in the folks who were religious. I remember my grandmother would bring me to church. People would say one thing at church and do another.&nbsp;</p><p>The way Liz Murray put herself out is surely going to motive those who are struggling in their lives one way or the other, and if you look over your shoulder for inspiration for facing these issues, you need not look any further than Liz.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The one who had a dark phase in her childhood is now an inspiration to many across the world and her works have not only inspired people but have also helped her finances. But still, she has not revealed any official statement on the exact&nbsp;figure of her net worth.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWhqmK6tr7RmrBmnaaau265wKupop2UYsSwucCnZKKmo6W2s63ToqanZZ%2BrsrOvwKacZqCfp7%2BqssicZJ%2BZnZ65unnCqKWdoaSevK95x56pqGaYqbqt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html&text=Liz%20Murray%20Even%20As%20A%20Married%20Woman%20Is%20An%20Inspiration%3b%20Overcame%20A%20Horrific%20Family%20Condition%20Like%20A%20He&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html&title=Liz%20Murray%20Even%20As%20A%20Married%20Woman%20Is%20An%20Inspiration%3b%20Overcame%20A%20Horrific%20Family%20Condition%20Like%20A%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html&title=Liz%20Murray%20Even%20As%20A%20Married%20Woman%20Is%20An%20Inspiration%3b%20Overcame%20A%20Horrific%20Family%20Condition%20Like%20A%20He" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html&title=Liz%20Murray%20Even%20As%20A%20Married%20Woman%20Is%20An%20Inspiration%3b%20Overcame%20A%20Horrific%20Family%20Condition%20Like%20A%20He" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliz-murray-even-married-woman-inspiration-overcame-horrific-family-condition-hero-html.html&description=Liz%20Murray%20Even%20As%20A%20Married%20Woman%20Is%20An%20Inspiration%3b%20Overcame%20A%20Horrific%20Family%20Condition%20Like%20A%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mary-bruce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mary Bruce ABC News, Bio, Husband, Kids, Net Worth, Ig [Updated 2023]">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gordon-ramsay-daughter-holly-ramsay-wows-endless-legs-mini-dress-wiba-awards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Ramsay showcases never-ending legs in micro mini dress with a twist">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
