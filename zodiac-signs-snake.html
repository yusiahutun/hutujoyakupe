That’s why the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>snake that captures each zodiac sign</a> can say so much about the way you bend the truth and manipulate unsuspecting enemies. There’s at least one species that describes the way you slither around your problems and leave destruction in your wake.</p><p>From timeless trickster Jormungand of Norse mythology to the infamous serpent that enticed Eve to bite into forbidden fruit, snakes have always been associated with malicious intent. This is not to say snakes are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/zodiac/1614054/zodiac-signs-shark/>inherently evil creatures</a>, as they serve a vital purpose in sustaining their ecosystem and can be popular pets with reptile lovers. However, the sneaky, unexpected, and often terrifying methods they use to catch prey make them intimidating to humans on a primitive level. We’re literally trained to enter fight-or-flight at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the sight of a snake</a>, as human beings have evolved to have an innate fear of these slithering creatures. From squeezing their prey to death to injecting them with potent poisons, there are few animals more formidable than a snake. It’s no wonder that Slytherin House was made for Hogwarts students who were considered cunning, clever, and ambitious.</p><p>However, snakes are more than just villains of the animal world; they’re also symbolic of transformation and change. As the snake sheds its skin, it breaks free from the past and creates space for the future. And when you stumble across a snake whether <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in person or in your dreams</a>, it could be a sign from your spirit guides that you’re outgrowing your current circumstances and gearing up for a new chapter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-snake-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Snake That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Because everyone was born with their own strategies for sneaking, deceiving, and transforming, here’s the species of snake that captures each zodiac sign:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aries: You’re the Saw-scaled Viper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-998410922.jpg><p>Ruled by Mars—planet of war and combat—Aries never tires during a fight. The same goes for the saw-scaled viper, which has the impulse to quickly lunge into a venomous attack. And because Aries can be rather persistent, you’ll find that the saw-scaled viper has no problem biting you over and over again. Despite the petite and unassuming size of this serpent, they’re actually the most lethal snake of all time and they’re to blame for the deaths of more humans than any other species. And because they’re both nimble and fearless, they prefer to hide beneath shallow leaves on the ground, ready to pounce on their prey in a nanosecond.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Taurus: You’re the Mojave Rattlesnake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/98A7A5C1-2CD1-484C-BF9B-533813ED6E7F_1_201_a.jpeg><p>Taurus will typically do whatever they can to avoid going on the offensive. Like the rattlesnake, they would rather intimidate you from a distance before you start invading their space. Ruled by Venus—planet of culture and artistic expression—Taurus is most closely associated with music. And a rattlesnake literally uses the music of their keratin-based rattle to warn you of impending danger. Even though a Taurus generally appears harmless, you should still be careful, as you don’t want to catch a Taurus on a bad day. The same goes for the rattlesnake, because it could easily be a Mojave green, a.k.a. the most venomous rattlesnake of all.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Gemini: You’re the King Cobra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-538052908-1.jpg><p>You may think Geminis are ditzy and superficial, but there’s a lot going on in that complicated mind of theirs. Ruled by Mercury—planet of communication—Gemini is the biggest “people person” in the zodiac. And despite their terrifying appearance, so is the king cobra. This species can actually recognize their human handlers, making them easily domesticated and capable of communicating their desires. And like Geminis, they can easily sense a shift in the surrounding emotional energy. This is considered the smartest snake of them all, making them adaptable hunters that use situation-specific methods.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Cancer: You’re the Spiny Bush Viper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-475046770.jpg><p>Cancer is one of the most mystical and enchanting of zodiac signs, which is one of many things they have in common with the spiny bush viper. After all, this serpent literally looks more like a dragon than a snake. Ruled by the hard-shelled crab, Cancers are highly defensive and protective, often preferring to employ a tough exterior that wards off potential threats. The spiny bush viper relates, as their slithering bodies are covered with sharp hedgehog-like scales that can draw blood. Although they may appear like an adorable creature from a fantasy novel, you should never underestimate this species. Like a Cancer’s true intentions, their venom can be surprisingly potent and cause organ failure.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Leo: You're the Sunbeam Snake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/6EA067A7-8CFC-4FF9-A8CE-4B50F73AAA50_1_201_a.jpeg><p>Leo is often the most colorful, expressive, and creative person in their vicinity. Ruled by the sun, the world has a way of revolving around them, and it’s not always due to their self-centeredness, but instead their fashionable flare. The sunbeam snake is covered with iridescent scales that become a slithering rainbow whenever its surface is met with light. Despite their arresting appearance, this species is not venomous and not particularly known for being aggressive toward humans, matching their friendly Leo-like demeanor. In fact, they make extremely luxurious pets for snake lovers, as they always light up the room and enchant everyone who meets them.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Virgo: You're the Black Mamba</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-114465032-1.jpg><p>Virgo is one of the most intelligent, efficient, and cunning of all zodiac signs, making them a perfect match for the infamous black mamba. This highly venomous and formidable species knows how to get from point A to point B, as the black mamba is considered the fastest of all serpent species and capable of slithering at speeds of up to 12 miles per hour. Just two drops of their venom will seal your fate, as everyone who has seen Kill Bill Vol. 2 will tell you. Plus, everyone knows that black mamba was late basketball star Kobe Bryant’s favorite nickname, and it just so happens the Lakers legend was also a Virgo.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.880829015544><h2>Libra: You’re the Hognose Snake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-518832297.jpg><p>It’s no secret that Libra would rather avoid conflict at all costs. Mars—planet of passion and aggression—is in detriment while moving through this cardinal air sign, as Libra’s peaceful and harmonious vibe is antithetical to the planet of war’s deadly and direct intentions. Like the hognose snake, a Libra would rather play dead than confront their enemies. This serpent literally curls into the fetal position, pretends to be deceased, and even emits a foul-smelling odor in order to avoid your negative energy. Luckily, Libra is ruled by Venus—planet of beauty—and the hognose is without a doubt the most adorable snake of all time. Just take a look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok’s famous and much-beloved Marshmallow</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4268149882904><h2>Scorpio: You’re the Boa Constrictor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1255503645.jpg><p>Scorpio is the zodiac sign of intimacy and energetic merging, as they have a tendency to waver between avoidant and anxious attachment. The boa constrictor has a similar method of securing their prey, as they use their heavy-bodied muscle to literally squeeze them to death. They’re a tribute to the necessity of enforcing firm boundaries, especially with a Scorpio. This fixed water sign is also associated with transformation and the boa’s biological engineering is a testament to evolution. This serpent species is one of the few that still has vestigial limbs, which appear as tiny hind legs. During snake evolution, “boas and pythons <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>diverged from the lineage</a> leading to advanced snakes before&nbsp;hind limbs&nbsp;were completely eliminated,” according to a 2016 article in Current Biology.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Sagittarius:&nbsp;You’re the Burmese Python</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-520683390-3.jpg><p>When it comes to Sagittarius, it’s always “the bigger, the better.” After all, Sagittarius is ruled by gas giant Jupiter, a planet that literally augments and enhances everything it touches. It’s no secret the Burmese python is the biggest snake on earth. It can reach up to 23 feet in length and weigh up to 200 pounds, making them the closest thing we have to a modern day monster. They’re also capable of stretching open their mouths to swallow prey whole and their iron stomach spends the next two weeks digesting their larger-than-life meals. Everyone knows a Jupiter-ruled Sag loves to indulge, especially because they have no known predators of their own to worry about.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Capricorn: You’re the Inland Taipan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taipan-Australian-length.webp?w=650"><p>Although Capricorns can appear boring or uptight on the surface, you should never judge a book by its cover and you should never underestimate this cardinal earth sign. Although Caps have a way of giving off a stoic and low-key vibe, there’s always a fierce warrior living inside them. The inland taipan can relate, because despite its brown and nondescript appearance, these snakes could unalive 100 humans with just one bite. Even though they are just one of many venomous creatures that dwell in the Australian outback, the inland taipan’s sharp needlepoint fangs possess the most lethal poison of all. And because Capricorns always aim for improvement, the venom of the inland taipan has evolved specifically for taking down warm-blooded animals… like us.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aquarius: You’re the Paradise Flying Snake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Paradise-flying-snake-Chrysopelea-paradisi.webp?w=650"><p>Aquarius is all about being unique and standing out from the crowd, even if they have to resort to illogical or eccentric measures in order to achieve it. That’s why they would have to be the paradise flying snake, because what now? Am I saying that some snakes can actually fly? Yes, I most certainly am. While the Chrysopelea paradisi does not have wings per se, they’re capable of undulating their bodies in a way that allows them to glide through the air for over 100 yards. It would only make sense for idealistic fixed air sign Aquarius to find a way to fly, even when all logic seems to point to the contrary.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Pisces: You're the Banded Sea Krait</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-638856734.jpg><p>Pisces may seem sweet, dreamy, and innocent, but there’s a lot more to them than meets the eye. Just like the banded sea krait slithers below the surface of the ocean, a Pisces is always immersed in a deep emotional world that few may understand. You wouldn’t expect a snake to survive so deep in the aquatic realm, just like you wouldn’t expect a Pisces to be able to withstand the sensitive and complicated energies they’re constantly absorbing. When a Pisces is angry with you, the last place you want to meet them is on their home turf. That’s why you definitely don’t want to be bitten by the highly venomous Hydrophis belcheri when you’re already holding your breath underwater.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbr%2FNmqKeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html&text=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20SnakesWhich%20Slithering%20Species%20Are%20You%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20SnakesWhich%20Slithering%20Species%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20SnakesWhich%20Slithering%20Species%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20SnakesWhich%20Slithering%20Species%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-snake.html&description=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20SnakesWhich%20Slithering%20Species%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./futbol-internacional.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Douglas Costa: &amp;quot;Tengo miedo de volver a Ucrania&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./luxe-listings-sydney-star-gavin-rubinstein-secretly-dating-model-alexandra-dankwa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luxe Listings Sydney star Gavin Rubinstein has been 'secretly dating model Alexandra Dankwa'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
