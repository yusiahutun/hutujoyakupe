Skylar's mother worked as an administrative assistant in a cardiac laboratory, and her father, David, worked as a product assembler at Walmart.</p><p class=align-left>Neese attended University High School and was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great student</a>. According to her parents, she was a high achiever in academia, excelling in almost every subject, regardless of whether she liked them or not.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Donnah Winger murder case: What happened to convict Mark Winger?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Everyone knew Skylar as a bubbly girl and a loyal friend at school. Her <a href=#>dream career </a>was to become a criminal defense attorney. On top of this, she worked at Wendy's with her two close friends when she was in school.</p><p class=align-left>Skylar’s disappearance</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61d1c079a0a64c2c.jpg><p class=align-left>Skylar’s story is one of the most puzzling, considering the young personalities involved in her murder case. How could such young people perform the unimaginable act? Well, you will be surprised at how the story starts and builds up to the eventual murder.</p><p class=align-left>Skylar Neese had two best friends, Shelia Eddy and <a href=#>Rachel Shoaf</a>. However, it wasn't always the three of them. Skylar met Eddy when they were in elementary school, and Shoaf joined them during their freshman year in high school. And that is where things start getting interesting.</p><p class=align-left>As you might have guessed, the once inseparable duo of Skylar and Shelia was no more, as Rachel made it a trio. The new friendship drove a wedge between Skylar and Eddy, but they coped as friends do. After all, it was about supporting one another.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cdcdb09edb7f16c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Bernadette Protti: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, it was never a balanced friendship after Shoaf’s arrival as Neese started competing with her to be the closest friend of Eddy, who liked the attention. Also, Neese served as an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">emotional rock</a> for the trio as both Eddy and Shoaf had divorced parents.</p><p class=align-left>On July 5, 2012, Skylar Neese <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">snuck out</a> of her parent’s home in Morgantown, West Virginia, to hang out with her friends. They resided on the ground floor, and Skylar used a bench under her bedroom window to climb out, meeting her two friends, Rachel and Eddy, outside waiting in a car.</p><p class=align-left>Skylar's parents found out that their daughter had sneaked out through the window the following morning. And at the window was the bench she used to reach the exit. Also, surveillance footage showed Neese climbing out of the window.</p><p class=align-left>And that was the beginning of the nightmare, which necessitated the involvement of the police. Skylar's parents called the precinct to report her disappearance. Her friends claimed that they had dropped her home at around midnight.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The giant red flag was that Neese did not report to work the following morning and her cell phone, charger, toothbrush, and toiletries were still in her room.</p><p class=align-left>Also, an Amber alert was not issued after her parents discovered her disappearance because the circumstances did not meet all the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four criteria</a> to give one.</p><h2>Speculations about her whereabouts</h2><p class=align-left>Eddy and Neese’s mother helped roam the neighbourhood, searching for Skylar Neese on July 7, 2012. The other friend, Rachel Shoaf, had gone to Catholic summer camp for two weeks.</p><p class=align-left>Speculations ran high that Skylar went to a party and overdosed on heroin. According to corporal Ronnie Gaskins, some teenagers informed him that Skylar had attended a party and died. Those who attended panicked and disposed of the body.</p><h2>Skylar Neese’s murder</h2><p class=align-left>How and why was Skylar Neese murdered? The most twisted thing about Skylar's murder is that her friend, Shelia Eddy, called her parents, informing them that they had hanged out and dropped her off before midnight. She even insisted that they dropped her at the end of the road as she did not want to wake her parents up sneaking back in.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f73ab4630959f67.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sidney Starr: real name, partner, life story, before and after pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But grainy footage showed that the car never returned after leaving at 12:35 am. That's because Skylar's two friends <a href=#>murdered her</a> after she left home that fateful night.</p><p class=align-left>The car's trunk had the classic serial killer kit, including towels, bleach, shovel, and change of clothes. Also, they had packed knives they used to kill Skylar Neese.</p><p class=align-left>Rachel and Eddy drove Skylar Neese to an isolated location in Pennsylvania, where they smoked used to hang out. At the familiar spot, Skylar's two friends stabbed her to death. According to their testimony, they counted to three and attacked her with knives, stabbing her until she stopped making weird sounds.</p><p class=align-left>After killing her, Rachel and Eddy planned to bury her body. However, the ground was too hard for them to dig with a shovel, and they decided to hide the body in a nearby thicket and cover it with branches.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Skylar's body wasn't discovered until three months later when Rachel Shoaf led detectives to the exact location.</p><h2>What did the investigation reveal?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg><p class=align-left>The police were suspicious of the rumours and stories about Skylar’s disappearance and knew something was up. However, they could not make any arrests as they had nothing concrete.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, social media provided the investigators with some direction on the case. According to the trio's Twitter and Facebook, it appeared as though they had some contention.</p><p class=align-left>The afternoon that Skylar Neese disappeared, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she tweeted</a>, "Sick of being at fu#$ing home. Thanks ‘friends’, love hanging out with you all too. And the day she disappeared, she tweeted, “You doing s*** like that is why I can NEVER completely trust you.”</p><p class=align-left>One of the investigators created a fake online persona and connected with the girls to find out more about their lives. And they noted that none of the girls was upset about their friend's disappearance, which was strange.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98cdd5cfdcf4cbee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie McGrath: height, sexuality, spouse, heterochromia, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Once investigators caught the girls in a lie (claimed they went east, but their car was spotted in Blackstone, West Virginia), they knew they were on to something.

According to her confession, they had planned to carry out the murder just before she left for summer camp.</p><p class=align-left>When Rachel Shoaf was asked why she and her friend murdered Skylar, she stated they did not like her.</p><h2>What happened to the killers of Skylar Neese?</h2><p class=align-left>Rachel Shoaf was charged with murder after her confession. They went to the location where the body was disposed for the first, as specified by Rachel, but couldn’t find the body.
