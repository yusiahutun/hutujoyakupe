Part of me is still waiting for one of your crazy phone calls. So many things left unsaid and moments we didn’t share. Trying not to dwell on the missed moments and focusing on the improvements we made. You had a zest for life and I know you’re having a party up in heaven. Rest in peace dad.

She went on to explain that she distanced herself from her father growing up because “I didn’t know how to do anything else any other way.”</p><p>Nicole explained in The Real Housewives of Miami that her father was jailed for money laundering when she was younger, leaving her mother, Sirel, to raise her and her brother as a single mom. She went on to explain how the birth of her son, Greyson, with her fiance, Anthony Lopez, made her want to repair her relationship with her father. “I know this isn’t going to be easy. But I know I’ve gotta let this go if there’s any hopes of having, you know, a true bond with my dad,” she said in a confessional interview.</p><p>During an episode of Watch What Happens Live in February 2023, Nicole revealed that she and her dad were in a “much better place” after filming ended on The Real Housewives of Miami Season 5. “I think viewers will get to see our therapy and sessions and journey through this, but yes, we are in a much better place,” she said. “I feel like it was an elephant in the room for years, and because of the show, we kind of had to face that our relationship wasn’t ideal and we had to talk about things and we ultimately ended up in therapy. I don’t think I would have done that [if it weren’t for the show].”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Miami airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Bravo and is available to stream on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Peacock</a>.
