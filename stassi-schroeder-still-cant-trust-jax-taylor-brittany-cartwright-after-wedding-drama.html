"We didn't get to have one. We literally just signed papers in <a href=#><strong>Katie [Maloney's]</strong></a> backyard during my baby shower during COVID with less than 10 people. ... It wasn't a wedding."</p><p>Over a year after the fallout, Stassi -- who is expecting her second child with Beau -- said she does still "miss" Jax and Brittany "at times," however, she can't forget what happened.</p><p>"I follow them still, and see what they're up to in their lives, and Cruz is so cute, and all of that," she said, referring to Jax and Brittany's 2-year-old son. "But they hurt me -- they really did -- and it feels like I can't trust them anymore."</p><p>In May 2022, Stassi and Beau tied the knot for the second time in Rome, Italy. Stassi's <a href=#><strong>fallout </strong></a>with Jax and Brittany began after they didn't attend the nuptials.</p><p>As noted during Stassi's appearance on The Toast podcast, Jax and Brittany have previously claimed they couldn't attend the wedding last minute because Cruz's passport didn't come in on time. However, Stassi has said the main issue for her and Beau was that Jax allegedly spoke behind their back about not being able to go to the wedding weeks prior.</p><p>The reality star first alluded to the drama on an episode of her and Beau's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://www.patreon.com/thegoodthebadthebaby><strong>The Good, the Bad, and the Baby</strong></a> podcast a few weeks after their wedding.</p><p>During the podcast episode, Stassi and her husband appeared to go off on Brittany and Jax. Although they didn't "name names," it was clear Stassi and Beau were talking about Brittany and Jax.</p><p>Stassi claimed Jax and Brittany told them they would no longer be going to their wedding "two hours" before they were leaving for Italy. However, Beau alleged that he had received screenshots from friends -- dating back to about a month before their nuptials -- that showed Jax saying he wasn't attending the wedding.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a0e08c0a-5351-4e99-b734-1169b75f68e1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:55c0854f-5b34-4b1c-b584-8d0210bb0c0e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/04/5by4/2023/06/01/047e2067c4304ba197433ebff7738c89_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Stassi Schroeder Complains She Was Kicked Off Universal Studios Ride For Being Pregnant</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"They are RSVP'd 'yes,'" Stassi said. "'[And] whenever we were around them, they're like, 'We’re coming.' Then it kept happening. And two weeks before the wedding, I was like, 'We need to address this with them because I'm not playing this game.' I ordered all the stuff we needed to have in terms of seat assignments and the place cards. So I need to know if I need to quickly ask to get things rearranged."</p><p>"The day, not 24 hours before, the day we're leaving for our flight to go to Rome, two hours before we leave the house, I'm sitting on the couch," she recalled. "Our suitcases are by the front door, everything’s done… I get a text from the girl part of this relationship saying, 'We're not coming,' with many, many reasons as to why they’re not coming. It was a novel. Two hours before I'm about to go to the airport to get married I get a text from friends that are supposed to be our close friends that they’re not going to make it. It was so mind-blowingly insane."</p><p>The Off with My Head author later added, "Good friends don't do that. They don't talk s--- about your wedding behind your back or pretend that they're coming and give a list of reasons why they’re not coming to other people. Friends don't do that to each other."</p><p>Meanwhile, Brittany has stressed that she and Jax wanted to attend, but they weren't able to make it work due to several reasons out of their control.</p><p>During<a href=#><strong> an appearance</strong></a> on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Betches Moms</strong></a> podcast in June 2022, Brittany explained, "Cruz's passport didn’t come in [and] my mom had a death in the family and had to go home. I mean, there was actual things that happened right before the wedding that we actually couldn't make it to the wedding for those reasons."</p><p>The 34-year-old noted that she felt "terrible" having to cancel at "the last minute" and expressed her regret over "not being able to be there for someone who I really do think of as one of my best friends."</p><a id=gallery-link-2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:55c0854f-5b34-4b1c-b584-8d0210bb0c0e data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2023/03/06/e6c42ba364a84997bd59e2b04f8ef053_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma2tfqMGiv9KiZKybmKe8prDEq2SsrJmhuW6vwKerZqyiqsC1ecmar2aska65sL6Mm6mirKSWu7p5wpqpra%2BinrSpwIyana2domLEprDDoqWgZZSnrq6tjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html&text=Stassi%20Schroeder%20Still%20%27Can%27t%20Trust%27%20Jax%20Taylor%20%26amp%3b%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20After%20Wedding%20Drama&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html&title=Stassi%20Schroeder%20Still%20%27Can%27t%20Trust%27%20Jax%20Taylor%20%26amp%3b%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20After%20Wedding%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html&title=Stassi%20Schroeder%20Still%20%27Can%27t%20Trust%27%20Jax%20Taylor%20%26amp%3b%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20After%20Wedding%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html&title=Stassi%20Schroeder%20Still%20%27Can%27t%20Trust%27%20Jax%20Taylor%20%26amp%3b%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20After%20Wedding%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstassi-schroeder-still-cant-trust-jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-after-wedding-drama.html&description=Stassi%20Schroeder%20Still%20%27Can%27t%20Trust%27%20Jax%20Taylor%20%26amp%3b%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20After%20Wedding%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./angell-conwell-married-boyfriend-affair-omar-gooding-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angell Conwell Married, Boyfriend, Affair, Omar Gooding, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./spider-man-spider-mans-miles-morales-may-not-be.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Mans Miles Morales may not be LGBT, but the popular superhero movie i">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
