Those possessing sensitive and acne-prone skin may vouch for a sunblock that has a gentle formula. The ones with oily skin may pick a sunscreen that has a matte finish. Likewise, the ones with dry skin may get their hands on a hydrating and moisturizing sunscreen. Never invest in any of the sunscreens that are not meant for your skin type.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Always pay heed to the list of ingredients mentioned on the sunscreen that you are buying. It is advisable to invest in a plant-based sunscreen to wear under makeup or the one that is infused with vitamins, niacinamide, zinc oxide, and active ingredients. Avoid splurging on creams that contain sulfates, parabens, gluten, or any harsh chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Texture</strong>: The next important aspect to consider is the texture of sunscreen. You will find them in a variety like gel, lotion, cream, etc. All of them are effective but make sure they possess a blendable, silky-smooth, and light-in-weight texture. Secondly, they should absorb into your skin quickly without leaving a white residue behind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: Ensure that you check the formula of the sunscreen. It is wise to invest in a vegan, cruelty-free, dermatologically-tested, non-comedogenic, allergy-tested, and water-resistant sunscreen to avoid any skin damage or reaction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Coverage And SPF</strong>: Lastly, check the coverage and amount of sun protection factor (SPF) the sunscreen has to offer. Always pick a lightweight sunscreen that comes with SPF ranging between 35 to 50 and antioxidant protection. Such sunscreens lend you broad-spectrum coverage and maximum protection from harmful UV rays and environmental stressors.</p><p>After taking note of the above-mentioned aspects, allow us to help you with the proper steps for using one.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply Sunscreen Under Makeup?</h2></p><p>Following are a few steps to apply the best sunscreen to wear under makeup effectively -&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Cleanse your face with a cleanser or face wash.
