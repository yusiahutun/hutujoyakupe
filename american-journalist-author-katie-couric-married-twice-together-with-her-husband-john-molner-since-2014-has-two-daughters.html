She was utterly devastated when her husband, attorney <strong>John Paul "Jay" Monahan,</strong> died of colon cancer in 1998. The mother-of-two, however, managed everything and made a new start in life.</p><p>Couric is now happily married to her husband, <strong>John Molner</strong>. They have been living a conjugal life since 2014. Both being married twice, they have every reason to celebrate their togetherness.</p><h2>Katie Couric Living A Blessed Life With John Molner</h2><p>Katie Couric immediately fell for her future husband, John Molner, but it took some time for the case Molner.</p><p>It was rather coincident how she met Molner via her friend Molly. During an interview with PEOPLE's Editor-in-Chief<strong>&nbsp;Jess Cagle</strong> in The Jess Cagle, she shared some details about her past days with Molner.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/katie-and-john.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Katie Couric with her husband, John Molner</strong></p><p><strong>Source: US Magazine</strong></p><p>She said,</p><p>"In 2012 I was single again and I asked a friend of mine, Molly, whose husband is a trauma surgeon&nbsp;if her husband knew any other doctors because I thought I’d like to go out with a doctor."</p><p>"And so she thought about it and she said, ‘We don’t really know a doctor, but we do know this banker named John Molner.’ And I said, ‘Does he have a pulse?’"</p><p>When Molner never called her, Couric again made the second attempt and asked her friend about him again. The two met at a restaurant, and things just got started then.</p><p>After two years of dating, Couric engaged the financer in September 2013 and finally exchanged vows on 21 June 2014 in a small, private ceremony at her home in The Hamptons.</p><p>The bride looked gorgeous in an ivory crystal beaded and embroidered Chantilly lace gown, while the groom looked dapper in a dark blue suit and crisp white shirt.</p><p>Couric posed with three friends in matching hit pink dresses during the ceremony, and her daughters also attended the event. It was the second marriage of both Molner and Couric.</p><p>The CNN Evening News anchor's first husband died of colon cancer, while Molner separated from his first wife with whom he has two kids, <strong>Allie</strong> and <strong>Henry</strong>.</p><p>Talking about her married life with Molner, she said,</p><p>"It took me a long time [to marry again] because I loved being married and I love being married now.&nbsp;And I’m not a solitary person. I like the company. And John is so funny. He’s just got this incredibly dry and wry sense of humor, and he doesn’t take himself too seriously. And he’s just fun to be around."</p><p>The couple appeared together in the online cooking series 'Full Plate with Katie & John' on the Sur La Table website.&nbsp;</p><p>We wish them all the very best for their blessed life ahead.</p><h2>Katie Couric's Life With Jay Monahan</h2><p>Couric was previously married to John Paul "Jay" Monahan in 1989. Everything was excellent between the two, and their relationship was going on without a break.</p><p>They welcomed their first daughter&nbsp;<strong>Elinor Tully "Ellie" Monahan,</strong> in 1991 in Washington, D.C., and the second daughter <strong>Caroline "Carrie,"</strong> in 1996 in New York City.</p><p>The family life of four was an example for many, but everything changed suddenly when her husband died of colon cancer at the age of 42 in 1998.</p><p>Despite the bitter moment, Couric didn't break down and became a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness. Not only colon cancer, but she also became part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month on 7 October 2005 and shared her mammogram on the Today show.</p><p>She's also active in the National Hockey League's Hockey Fights Cancer. In addition to it, she appeared in some public service announcements and did many voice-overs.</p><h2>Katie Couric: Quick Facts</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/katie-couric-pic.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source: Variety</strong></p><ul><li>She was born on 7 January 1957 in Arlington, Virginia, to the family of Elinor Tullie (nee Hene) and John Martin Couric.</li><li>She studied at Arlington Public Schools:&nbsp;Williamsburg Middle School, Yorktown High School, and&nbsp; Jamestown Elementary.</li><li>She completed her graduation with a bachelor's degree in American Studies in 1979.</li><li>She has worked on CNN, NBC News, ABC News, and CBS News.</li><li>She is well-noticed for her work as a co-host of Today and the CBS Evening News anchor.</li><li>Her father died in 2011 due to<a href=#> Parkinson's disease</a> and its complication.</li><li>Her sister Emily Couric died of pancreatic cancer at 54 in October 2001.</li><li>She broadcasted her mammogram the part of National<a href=#> Breast Cancer </a>Awareness Month in October 2005.</li><li>She has an estimated net worth of<strong> $110 million</strong> and an annual salary of<strong> $10 million</strong> per <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a></strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Stay updated in<a href=# rel=noopener> Married Wiki</a> for more celebrity articles.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiucSroJyZnmK3sMHRp5iloaOpeqLB06Gmq2WblsGqsYycpq6qmZh6rq3Rq6CenF2pxKqvxGarqJ%2BVqbWmvoywoK2gXZ2ys3nHrqqbmZ6Zequ7x6dkpqeco7KzedKipZydXWd9coCMoZisZaSsvG6wwK6eoayVp8A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html&text=American%20Journalist-Author%20Katie%20Couric%20Lost%20Her%20First%20Husband%20To%20Colon%20Cancer%3b%20Married%20Second%20Time%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html&title=American%20Journalist-Author%20Katie%20Couric%20Lost%20Her%20First%20Husband%20To%20Colon%20Cancer%3b%20Married%20Second%20Time%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html&title=American%20Journalist-Author%20Katie%20Couric%20Lost%20Her%20First%20Husband%20To%20Colon%20Cancer%3b%20Married%20Second%20Time%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html&title=American%20Journalist-Author%20Katie%20Couric%20Lost%20Her%20First%20Husband%20To%20Colon%20Cancer%3b%20Married%20Second%20Time%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famerican-journalist-author-katie-couric-married-twice-together-with-her-husband-john-molner-since-2014-has-two-daughters.html&description=American%20Journalist-Author%20Katie%20Couric%20Lost%20Her%20First%20Husband%20To%20Colon%20Cancer%3b%20Married%20Second%20Time%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./camron-pink-range-rover-ebay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cam'ron's Pink Range Rover Up For Sale On Facebook Marketplace">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./12-surprising-facts-about-estadio-mario-alberto-kempes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Surprising Facts About Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
