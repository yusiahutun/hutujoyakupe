For some, that might mean luxurious, chunky knitwear or a changeover from denim jackets to wool coats — but for others, pants are on the mind. When it comes to fall dressing, corduroy pants are the definitive choice for bottoms, synonymous with the season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the durable textile has been around since the 18th century, corduroy came into the 20th century as a modern-day fabric in the 1970s, often worn by anti-establishment personas with cultural clout. Since then, the fabric has seen resurgences every few decades, but as of late, the best corduroy pants have become a closet classic that most brands and designers offer in the fall and winter months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I think a lot of people view corduroy as an older and more classic fabric but in the past few years we’ve seen its return to designer collections,” says fashion stylist and consultant Emily Holland. “Modern brands are having fun with corduroy, designing cooler silhouettes and fun colorways, making it a great wardrobe staple.” As the resurgence in fashionability and consumer demand has increased, so have the numerous options available on the market.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why we are here to help. We researched the best corduroy pants available to shop now and tapped three fashion experts to poll their most beloved picks for the season ahead. From wide-leg to tapered, leggings and straight-leg, find your perfect pair here. Don’t worry — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>styling tips</a> are also included for each and every one.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-universal-standard-cassidy-high-rise-straight-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Cassidy High Rise Straight Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Cassidy High Rise Straight Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4FD7oeQNy2k-UOGP3sxbwo0E3HQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-standard-cassidy-high-rise-straight-corduroy-pants-f8415e99b6c248a690fab86f7611a4af.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A diverse size range to choose from (00–40)</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 30-inch inseam might be too long for petites.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Universal Standard’s Cassidy pants are high-rise, straight-cut trousers made from stretch corduroy. The brand’s extended size range is really what sets this pair out from the rest, for fashion stylist and brand consultant Ashley Afriyie. “Universal Standard was way ahead of their time when they expanded their sizing past the typical 33/34 you often see with most brands,” she says. “The brand’s ethos is all about exclusivity and they have the best ‘give back’ initiatives.” Not only do these pants come in 00–40, [but] they also are available in seven different colorways. Afriyie recommends the Rioja colorway for autumn. “I love this deep maroon color because it is such a nice segue into the fall season,” she explains. “They can be paired with a boot during the cold season or flats when the weather is cool.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–40 | <strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, elastane&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-gap-mid-rise-loose-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gap Mid-Rise Loose Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gap Mid-Rise Loose Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZP_HPn62THy-t3s3XgYUr0vYyYE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gap-mid-rise-loose-corduroy-pants-7d2dc26443d043aea009153a0692bd4a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gap</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The classic mid rise and under-$100 price point — it's a great value.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Runs on the larger side.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Holland loves the ease and classicism of Gap’s mid-rise cords. Available in sizes 00–20 in regular, tall, and petite, they are a great option that covers the bases for many body types. A relaxed fit is loose through the hip, thigh, and leg, making them a comfortable choice, as does the touch of stretch feel coming from 2 percent spandex mixed in with the cotton fabrication. Featuring a 10-inch rise that hits in the middle, they’re not too high or low-waisted, just right in the middle. These pants also have an eco-friendly element, as they are a part of the brand’s Washwell program, which eliminates the use of excess water during the production process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–20 regular, tall, petite | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-trouser-frame-le-hardy-high-waist-wide-leg-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Trouser</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FRAME Wide Leg Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FRAME Le Hardy High Waist Wide Leg Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eD3-c_wGP9sYsURhNrlLAsnC_jo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frame-le-hardy-high-waist-wide-leg-corduroy-pants-fce45d6ac0e949d3b81c89101aaabeee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The two-button extended waistband gives it a true trouser shape.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brand encourages sizing down, since the style runs large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another best-selling denim style that has been remade in corduroy fabric, Frame’s Le Hardy is an extremely high-waisted pant silhouette that fits just like your favorite trouser pant. “I love the wide-leg on these pants,” Afriyie says. “It is the perfect width without it feeling outdated — a more modern take on the bellbottoms.” The two-button waistband gives the pants a polished edge, while slit patch pockets add another stylish detail. When it comes to styling, Afriyie suggests pairing these light camel-colored pants with an equally luxe, cashmere sweater.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–34 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, elasterell-p, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-baggy-levis-womens-94-baggy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Baggy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Women’s 94 Baggy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi's Women&amp;acirc;s 94 Baggy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0OGcXBeVJ8wRoGBL83hCN-3QxOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-womens-94-baggy-pants-4bdb279689ea4e0787cbd8280cb4ae7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a favorite denim fit from Levi’s but made in corduroy fabrication.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It runs large.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The slouchy, worn-in feeling of Levi's baggy pants is well renowned. The corduroy interpretation is just as great as the denim, nodding to the relaxed silhouettes of the ‘90s while featuring a high waist that is entirely smoothing around the midsection of the female body. The straight leg has a relaxed look that is still appropriate enough in length to be worn with sneakers or flat shoes. We love the dark green colorway matched to the corduroy fabric, for that truly cold weather-appropriate feel. For a casual, weekend look, pair these pants with a cropped T-shirt, Converse high-tops, and a boxy jacket. If you’re looking for a way to wear them to the office, a ruffled blouse, a block-heeled leather boot, and a blazer is the perfect styling combination.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–34 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, recycled cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-ag-jeans-deven-tailored-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AG Jeans Deven Tailored Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AG Jeans Deven Tailored Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KSd-aF6Cu_CQqvwCdOS4u0UvEqk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ag-jeans-deven-tailored-corduroy-pants-e808b92ea7714d5ab0310ab2b986679a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The rich, autumnal-feeling color of the trousers.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 34-inch inseam may need to be tailored for petite women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Two experts recommended these corduroy pants. “AG Jeans created a beautiful style this season in this spiced maple shade,” says Jennifer Nisan, stylist and founder of Front Row Live. The rich colorway was also spotlighted by Afriyie, as a highlight of the garment’s design. “It’s a mix of a deep red with brown undertones that’s perfect for fall and winter,” Afriyie says. The ultra wide-leg shape was designed with a high-rise waistband, free from belt loops, as well as simple zip-fly and slash front pockets. Made primarily from cotton, the witty wide wale texture is described by Nisan as your “classic elephant cord” which she says gives the garment more of a luxe look, and can easily transition from day to night, from the office to drinks. “I would wear this with a fitted cropped sweater and heels and play off of the fabrics with a crotchet, a knit, and even a satin would look great,” Nissan says. Alternatively, Afriyie imagines styling hers with a knitted turtleneck and perfect heeled boots or a point heel, to balance the wide-leg bottom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–33 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-work-tory-burch-high-rise-wide-leg-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Work</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch High-Rise Wide-Leg Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tory Burch High-Rise Wide-Leg Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L5B_RoojbziCKD8s03yXmwOIV74=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tory-burch-high-rise-wide-leg-corduroy-pants-c34e5447b7da4e08b3bace759451743a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The gray colorway and wide-leg silhouette give off a professional feel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Not able to be machine washed, recommended to be professionally dry cleaned only.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tory Burch’s wide-leg corduroy pants are Holland’s pick for something on the dressier side. “These are a nice balance of feminine and masculine,” she says. “I love how they’re fitted in the waist but have a relaxed leg.” A classic, hook-and-bar waistband and zip-fly give the notion of being borrowed from the boys, but Tory Burch’s tailoring is made with the female form in mind. The flecked charcoal gray fabric can be effortlessly styled in a variety of ways. “Great for dressing up with a tucked-in blouse or wearing with an oversized sweater and sneakers,” Holland tells InStyle.

Organic cotton ensures the fabric has been mindfully considered, so you can feel good about this purchase.

The flare-leg pant has the '70s-inspired feel that is synonymous with the famed luxury house. “With a corduroy set, I love it worn together — it's a no-brainer and a really cool look,” says Nisan. “But I also love the pants mixed and matched and worn as separates, and it's a great opportunity to play with textures.” She recommends wearing these pants with a satin blazer, for a unique texture combination.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>FR34–FR46 | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday--other-stories-corduroy-trousers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>& Other Stories Corduroy Trousers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="&amp;amp; Other Stories Corduroy Trousers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5-eaZgoIicXEtrsZBGwjGn3WeSc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/other-stories-corduroy-trousers-b2e8bfad0d7e4a2db3e67d892a60bf32.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>& Other Stories&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The modal cotton blend fabrication gives these pants a super soft touch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It isn't offered in plus sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A simple, no-frills option at an accessible price point makes these trousers our best bet for everyday wear. A clean waistband, without belt loops, and a straight silhouette will take these pants from sunup to sundown without a hitch. The rich, chocolate brown color also can be worked in with so many wardrobe staples and colors — including black! (Yes, brown and black can be worn together). Pair yours with a black, fitted turtleneck, black leather belt, and black leather boots for a look that feels extremely Carolyn Bessette-inspired. Don’t forget the tortoiseshell headband and round sunnies to complete the minimalist, '90s aesthetic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–14 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, elastomultiester, spandex&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-good-american-good-skate-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide-Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Skate Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Skate Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uoYawMRnBqZG4aVZHALLk_Qkrl8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-good-skate-corduroy-pants-f718260788a94e3b8b65eb69be5c0a2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Gap-proof waistband ensures a perfect fit around the waist is possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The lightweight fabric might be a little thin for certain geographic region’s climates in the winter.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Good American also makes a classic style — think Ali MacGraw [in] 'Love Story' — and the best part is that this brand fits like a glove,” Nisan says. Known for their attention to detail where fits are concerned, Good American’s wide-leg, corduroy pants are made to fit everyone, with a relaxed look that is also extremely comfortable thanks to modal and elastane. Nisan plans to wear these all fall long, in place of jeans, to add a bit of seasonality into her wardrobe. “I suggest going full collegiate retro with these pants and pairing with a fitted turtleneck and a sleek boot or vintage style sneaker to finish the look,” she says. “This style will also pair well with a button-down and a blazer.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–26 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-agolde-low-slung-baggy-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AGOLDE Low Slung Baggy Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AGOLDE Low Slung Baggy Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6EbxGVUN4QtftMmH-Kd4-eEGTps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/agolde-low-slung-baggy-jeans-e78ab59d1d674dc38793526e83779e0d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have a rich, black tone and baggy fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There isn't any stretch to the fabric, for those who would prefer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If black jeans are your go-to for denim, try switching it up with a black corduroy for the colder seasons. AGOLDE’s button-fly pants have a relaxed, low-slung feel that is both comfortable and stylish. The mid-weight, non-stretchy corduroy material has the same five-pocket design as a true jean shape but will provide more warmth on colder days. To balance the volume on the bottom, we recommend styling something more fitted as the top layer. For instance, those in warmer climates can wear a T-shirt or silk blouse, while colder climates should try turtlenecks, a cashmere crewneck, and more. Then feel free to layer what jackets and outer layers you prefer — from boxy, cropped shapes to long, robe coats. When it comes to footwear, a Chelsea boot or leather boot with a block heel will balance the longer-length hem of the pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–34 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pleat-front-ayr-the-metropolitan-in-corduroy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pleat-Front</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AYR The Metropolitan in Corduroy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="AYR The Metropolitan in Corduroy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-xP8tdM3aDW4y6HNlHG72BbCXyg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ayr-the-metropolitan-in-corduroy-db646e8fb0d94fc3b44b3cfffc29ab1a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AYR</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Soft, pleated front gives a stylized, menswear twist.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>White color can be hard to keep clean while wearing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve had my eye on these for a bit,” says Holland. “I love the pleat, love the menswear vibe, and the soft white color.” AYR’s soft corduroy pants are based on another beloved favorite of the brand’s, the Metropolitan pant. The pleated front gives a masculine twist that feels cool and extremely modern. We also love the little pocket on the back, as well, for an added touch. The length works for a variety of heights, with a 27.25-inch inseam, so hemming won’t be necessary on most. The best part? They are machine-washable, making cleaning all the easier for the white colorway. (If you’re like us — unexpected spills happen often). Holland recommends styling these mid-rise, straight-leg pants with a cozy, oversized sweater and a belt to finish. We’d also wear them with a contrasting silk button-down and loafers for a chic, undone look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–16 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-legging-hue-womens-corduroy-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Legging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hue Women’s Corduroy Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hue Women&amp;acirc;s Corduroy Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jzuRMwzQVjkCg40pLDZ8wgsRth4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hue-womens-corduroy-leggings-c0d6a3af6156460ba149676c46404b99.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Full size range in multiple colorway options.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Fabric has synthetic materials mixed in with cotton.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the flared or wide-leg look is not your thing. No matter, you can still wear corduroys. Hue, a brand known for their hosiery, makes leggings with plenty of stretch — a fabric that truly moves with you. The thin-whale weave still feels like a garment, rather than an activewear legging, since it has a true waistband with snap closure. The snug fit allows you to style them with everything from sneakers to ballet flats, and even tucked into knee-high boots. Try playing with proportions when styling, either with an oversized top or sweater over the pants, or something more cropped that shows off the waistline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X in skinny and straight | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tapered-leg-alex-mill-cotton-corduroy-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tapered Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alex Mill Cotton Corduroy Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alex Mill Cotton Corduroy Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5StkNuleBn2VP7JDuNAb1-NIg0E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alex-mill-cotton-corduroy-pants-25db60caeaa34b2a858f3001b6a43895.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They look as though they were sourced from your favorite vintage store.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If not fitted correctly,<strong> </strong>the pleat-front could appear bulky with extra fabric around the midsection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If a tapered leg is more your shape, Alex Mill’s are the best. The vintage-inspired shape takes notes from a classic menswear design (see the notch detail along the back waistline and single flap back pocket) while still feeling modernly feminine. The pleated front and high-waisted fit fall straight into a tapered leg that has a slightly cropped hem, so nothing will drag on the floor. Cuff the bottom to show off your favorite pair of loafers, ballerina flats, or a leather boot. Style as a full look — with the matching waistcoat and tailored blazer — for a downtown New York feel, inspired by the city the brand is based in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–14 | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-nili-lotan-florence-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nili Lotan Florence Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nili Lotan Florence Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VTncvU107VsAZ2NgIG52GScojeA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nili-lotan-florence-pants-aa2e18dfe670442f8446274d632d24b2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The classic shape won’t go out of style.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The long hem might drag on the floor and get dirty.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nili Lotan is known for minimalist, wardrobe staple styles that never go out of fashion. Inspired by the rock and roll era of the 1970s, these high-waisted, wide-leg pants have a nostalgic mood but feel entirely modern in the creamy shade. “I’m clearly loving a winter white moment,” Holland says. “These guys have a smaller wale and two front pockets giving them a more polished look.” When styling, go for a winter white look — with tonal styling tops. A bohemian blouse (think Jane Birkin-inspired) will work for warmer days, while a cropped, cable knit turtleneck will look great as a winter dinner look. Try contrasting accessories like a black leather belt, black handbag, and black boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–12 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Touch&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The hand feel of the corduroy is the first quality Holland recommends. “You want a substantial-feeling corduroy which will make it feel more luxe and retain that transitional quality,” she says. Fabric composition also comes into play here, where touch is concerned. When the materials are made from cotton, without synthetics, the touch will be more luxed and also softer. Additional softness will come from cotton mixed with modal.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Corduroy Width&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Next, you will want to take a look at the corduroy width (or wales). “A thinner cord is going to give you more of that vintage look, a little collegiate, retro,” Nisan says. “A thicker cord looks more luxe and has a bit of a sheen to it.” When it comes to styling, Nisan suggests different ways based on the different widths. “A thicker cord [will] look great with gold jewelry and sleek boots,” she explains. “I’d style this to look very polished and chic. A thinner cord could be great with a sweater and sambas or a pair of retro sneakers.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Corduroy is a material that is fun to wear in different colors versus jeans,” Afriyie says. “I love being able to wear corduroy in different color pants that I normally wouldn't consider in the jean material.” Nowadays, the color spectrum runs the gamut.

Petites and tall people may want to look for styles with their inseam. Longer styles can always be hemmed, but trying a variety of shapes may be important to not lose the flare shape if shortened.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Design Details&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The details in a pair of corduroy really differentiates the vibe,” Holland says. “For example, pleats give a more menswear vibe.

Pocket placement also is something to consider, based on the body type, and the rise of the pants — whether it be low, mid, or high-rise.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is corduroy?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s a special fabric with raised details,” Afriyie says. “Very durable and oftentimes doesn’t require much maintenance.” Often made from cotton, the raised ridges define the fabric and create a velvety, pinstriped effect. “Traditionally corduroy is made from cotton but generally feels and looks heavier than a lot of other fabrics,” says Holland. “I’m also seeing cotton and wool blends, making it a great transitional piece heading into fall.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the different types of corduroy?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"There are tons of different types of corduroy depending on fabric — spandex, cotton, cotton blend, et cetera — and then also it varies based on the ‘wales’ or the cords,” Nisan says. “The super thin corduroy you see is called pinwale but the thicker, more luxe style is called elephant cord.” Holland thinks about the size of the ridge on the corduroy from a styling and design perspective, rather than technical. “The smaller wale makes for a more classic look while a wide wale cord might feel a bit more fashion and fun,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you think about styling corduroy?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It is such a strong piece because of the distinctive raise and material, so for me, if you wear corduroy pants, the top pairing shouldn’t overshadow the corduroy you’re wearing,” Afriyie explains. “The difference you see with jean versus corduroy styling for most is you can have fun with different colors. Don't get me wrong you can absolutely wear different colored jeans but classic washes always triumph.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The color variations are definitely a plus for styling, for Holland too. “A lot of corduroy come in warmer colors so I’d stick with that color palette when choosing a top,” she says. “If you’re into brighter, bolder colors I might opt for a corduroy in a bright color or a winter white.” Think of these trousers as an extension of your denim wardrobe though, not as a substitute. They’re super versatile with endless styling opportunities, just like denim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Alternatively, Nisan considers the seasonality before starting to style out her corduroys. “Corduroy just does not work in warm weather,” she says. In cool temperatures, she encourages playing up the retro element. “Corduroy is a fantastic play with texture (like velvet), so I prefer to pair it with a crisp button down, a belt, some bolder jewelry, and really play on the texture and richness of the look."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full-time freelance writer and fashion editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristina Rutkowski</a> has been covering all things style, trend, and shopping for over 10 years.
