"He just was so adamant and unpleasant about the whole situation and for me it was kind of, I don't want to say it was traumatizing, but it was extremely unpleasant. And it was kind of traumatizing in a way and I felt extremely uncomfortable."</p><p>Though she almost left the building and barely held back tears, she instead just stood her ground.</p><p>"He said, 'Well I'm not going to be the only photographer that's going to ask you to do this.' And I said, 'Well, I guess you're not the only photographer I'm going to say no to,'" Ferguson said. "When I left I was very happy that I spoke up for myself and stood my ground, but that was probably the worst modeling experience I've had. I think I was 19 or 20 at the time. I can't imagine, you know, younger girls that are in this industry and how difficult it must be for some of them in the situations that they are put into as well."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8f77e5c0-25f2-5f46-90ab-b70ab64303a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:be397a2c-5b0d-5a53-8448-32b2b98feb4c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f5/5by4/2018/08/14/f53250e249a55d538de800d648e31e6e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">E!</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Model Squad' Trailer Pulls the Curtain Back on Harsh Reality of Being a Model</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Now 26, Ferguson has some more experience under her belt, including shoots for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and Chanel. But as easy, breezy, beautiful as the modeling world seems, she's adamant that it's a lot of work.</p><p>"It takes a lot of dedication and hard work and you have to be mentally strong and just dedicated," she explained. "We grow up fast in this industry and most people think, 'Oh, it must be so easy to just stand there and get your pictures taken.' They just, they just don't have the knowledge of what we actually go through."</p><p>One downside of the industry is the constant rejection, something Ferguson goes through during the series as she learns she didn't make it in the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. It's a reality she didn't find difficult to put on camera.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6c9e30b9-6ac7-56d8-82f8-870a82c45a38 data-container-ref=toofab:article:be397a2c-5b0d-5a53-8448-32b2b98feb4c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1e/5by4/2018/08/22/1e9e9fdbca8456ebb2a0d5b4a7dae213_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kendall Jenner Says Her 'Words Were Twisted' Amid Widespread Backlash Over Modeling Comments</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"We've all been turned down for our fair share of shows. And so for me -- it was obviously and still is a goal of mine -- but I didn't have high expectations," she said. "I tried to prepare myself as best as possible -- physically and mentally -- going into the casting and all I can do is be my best version of myself and hope that I'm something that they are looking for and if it's not that year, maybe it will be this year, you know?"</p><p>Ferguson said she was actually more emotional when she got her first callback for the runway show then when later learned they didn't choose her. "All you can do is just try, try again," she added, saying she was still excited for her friends who made the cut.</p><p>"You never really know what clients are looking for, you know? I feel like every year there's something new, something different," she continued. "You just have to kind of prepare yourself as best as you possibly can and you know, go in with your head up and shoulders back and do your best and see what happens."</p><p>Ferguson also told TooFab she was excited to throw a reality TV camera into the mix and is "super anxious" to see how "Model Squad" is received by its viewers.</p><p>The show debuts September 4 on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3FmbGhfnby4ecyom56kXai%2Btq3DZqqtmaJitaK6zZqfZp6Vp7S2v86nZKysn6Sxbr%2FTq6ann12eu27Bzamjnpmjlru1edKhpqisXay2tbSMqaysoKlivam706ieq5mgnbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html&text=Hannah%20Ferguson%20Describes%20%27Unpleasant%27%20Shoot%20with%20Pushy%20Photographer%20Who%20Wanted%20to%20Get%20Her%20Nude&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html&title=Hannah%20Ferguson%20Describes%20%27Unpleasant%27%20Shoot%20with%20Pushy%20Photographer%20Who%20Wanted%20to%20Get%20Her%20Nude" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html&title=Hannah%20Ferguson%20Describes%20%27Unpleasant%27%20Shoot%20with%20Pushy%20Photographer%20Who%20Wanted%20to%20Get%20Her%20Nude" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html&title=Hannah%20Ferguson%20Describes%20%27Unpleasant%27%20Shoot%20with%20Pushy%20Photographer%20Who%20Wanted%20to%20Get%20Her%20Nude" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-model-squad-star-hannah-ferguson-stood-strong-in-unpleasant-shoot-with-pushy-photographer.html&description=Hannah%20Ferguson%20Describes%20%27Unpleasant%27%20Shoot%20with%20Pushy%20Photographer%20Who%20Wanted%20to%20Get%20Her%20Nude" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luke-bryan-joke-blake-shelton-marry-gwen-stefani.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luke Bryan Kids Blake Shelton Over What Gwen Stefani Sees in Him">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-satin-dresses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best satin dresses for 2023: From slinky midi dresses to floral maxi dresses summer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
