This followed the death of his mom, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, at the age of 96 who was the longest reigning monarch of the UK in history – but curiosity turns to the shortest in the list. The British monarchy has approximately been in place for 1,200 years – which is quite a feat. Over that time, there has been 63 people crowned as the island’s head of state, with a sprinkle of wars in between throughout the ages.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-the-uk-s-shortest-reigning-monarch-lady-jane-grey>Who was the UK’s shortest reigning monarch, Lady Jane Grey?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-938548046-832x1024.jpg><p>Lady Jane Grey is the shortest reigning queen of England and Ireland, after she sat on the throne as monarch for just nine days. Her reign lasted from July 10 until July 19, back in 1553.</p><p>After King Edward VI’s death, he named three people in his will as future monarchs. This included his cousin and, Lady Grey. Grey was named in the will because his sister Mary was a Catholic and Jane was protestant. This meant she would support the reformed Church of England, which Edward had helped build.</p><p>After Edward’s death on July 10, Jane awaited coronation in the Tower of London, but her followers were quick to abandon her and give support to Edward’s sister instead. In the November of that year, she was charged with high treason at age 16, which carried the sentence of death.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>King Charles has managed to evade three things that can ‘kill a monarchy’, author says</a></p><p>Jane was initially spared the death penalty, but then her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, became involved in protesting Mary’s marriage to Philip of Spain.</p><p>Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley were then executed a year later in 1554.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-shortest-reigning-king-was-only-on-the-uk-throne-for-2-months>The shortest reigning king was only on the UK throne for 2 months</h2><p>The shortest reigning king in UK history is known as Edgar Ætheling. The young man was only on the throne for two months at age 15. When his great-uncle and predecessor King Edward the Confessor died in 1066, there was a power struggle. Still in his early teens, Edgar was deemed too young to become king, something which had not occurred before.</p><p>Edward had not prepared his nephew for the throne, and there was a war brewing. It was clear to those around him that Edgar would not be able to fight and so he was replaced. The Witan, who was the king’s council between the seventh and 11th centuries, chose Harold Godwinson as his replacement.</p><p>However, Henry died during the Battle of Hastings, and so some considered actually making Edgar king. This did not come to fruition, however, resolve against William the Conqueror began to weaken and he was eventually crowned king. He attended King William’s coronation and paid homage to him alongside other lords.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-could-leave-the-throne-sooner-than-expected>King Charles could leave the throne sooner than expected</h2><p>It was claimed last year by royal author Clive Irving King <a href=#>Charles would step down from the throne</a> when he was 80 years old, meaning his reign would be much longer than Lady Jane Grey’s.</p><p>Irving claimed: “He [Charles] wants to just have his moment in the limelight for a few years. Make sure that William and Harry are carried through what’s going to be an incredibly difficult transitional phase for the monarchy.”</p><p>However, <a href=#>Prince William</a> has said he is not yet ready to become king and tries not to think about it. “I certainly don’t lie awake at night waiting or hoping for it because it sadly means my family has moved on, and I don’t want that,” he reportedly said.</p><p>It is possible Charles could step down, as that’s what his great uncle, Edward VIII, did. However, it’s usually the norm for a monarch to serve until their death, like Queen Elizabeth II, who was on the throne for 70 years. He also made a similar promise to the nation as his mom had done in her speech.</p><p>He said in his first speech as king: “Queen Elizabeth was a life well lived; a promise with destiny kept and she is mourned most deeply in her passing. That promise of lifelong service I renew to you all today …</p><p>“Wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the Realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavor to serve you with loyalty, respect, and love, as I have throughout my life.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Queen Camilla is central to Charles’ reign as king – not Prince William, expert says</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WDcMPHqGSiq12ptaZ50qGmq6yVqMFuvsSinqehnpx6rrvNmqmcoF2ks27Ax55krqNdlruledahoJygXaC2r7OMpZyfrF2ptaZ506GpqKaVYrKivsuyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html&text=Who%20is%20the%20shortest%20reigning%20monarch%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20which%20King%20left%20the%20throne%20early%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20shortest%20reigning%20monarch%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20which%20King%20left%20the%20throne%20early%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20shortest%20reigning%20monarch%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20which%20King%20left%20the%20throne%20early%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html&title=Who%20is%20the%20shortest%20reigning%20monarch%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20which%20King%20left%20the%20throne%20early%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-shortest-reigning-monarch-of-the-uk-and-which-king-left-the-throne-early.html&description=Who%20is%20the%20shortest%20reigning%20monarch%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20which%20King%20left%20the%20throne%20early%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wolds-spokesman-he-was-beside-himself-after-davenport-building-collapse.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wolds spokesman: He was beside himself after Davenport building collapse">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tula-firm-up-deep-wrinkle-serum.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Take 30% Off Your Entire Tula Purchase on Black Friday">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
