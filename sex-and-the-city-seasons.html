(And yes, we certainly acknowledge some of it hasn’t aged well.)</p><p>The original show aired from 1998 to 2004 and spanned six seasons. Created by Darren Star and based on the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell, the show follows <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the lives of Carrie Bradshaw</a> (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), a sex columnist and writer; Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall), a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>confident and sexually liberated</a> public relations executive; Charlotte York (played by Kristin Davis), a preppy gallery curator and hopeless romantic; and Miranda Hobbes (played by Cynthia Nixon), a career-focused lawyer (and our personal favorite).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=best-sex-and-the-city-seasons-ranked-from-worst-to-best>Best Sex and the City seasons ranked from worst to best</h2><p>The show explores various themes related <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to modern relationships</a>, sexuality, feminism, and the challenges women face in their personal and professional lives. The show gained a large following and received critical acclaim for its portrayal of female friendships, candid discussions about sex, and its incredible fashion moments courtesy of costume designer, Patricia Field. Without further ado, here are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best Sex And The City seasons</a> in order of worst to best.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Season 5</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-5.png><p>Sex and The City‘s fifth season was cut short because of Sarah Jessica Parker’s pregnancy and comprised just 8 episodes compared to the 18 to 20 usually seen in other seasons. Some of the storylines felt rushed. We did appreciate the honest and nuanced depiction of Miranda’s new life as a mother, but we would’ve liked to have seen this fleshed out even more.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Season 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-3.jpeg><p>Some of the most important relationships in Sex and the City have their roots in season 3. We’re introduced to Aiden, a furniture designer that Carrie falls for after another blowout with Mr. Big. And then, the show’s most notorious arc: Carrie cheating on Aiden with her now-married ex. Charlotte meets, marries, and splits from Trey McDougal, who is perfect for her on paper, and Miranda’s relationship with Steve continues to evolve but ultimately reaches its conclusion (for now). And Samantha moves out of her Upper East Side apartment to the Meatpacking District.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11><h2>Season 1</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-1.webp?w=650"><p>“Once upon a time, an English journalist came to New York,” the opening voice-over by Carrie begins. “Elizabeth was attractive and bright and right away she hooked up with one of the city’s typically eligible bachelors. Tim was 42; a well-liked and respected investment banker who made about 2 million a year. They met one evening in typical New York fashion at a gallery opening. It was love at first sight. For 2 weeks they snuggled, went to romantic restaurants, had wonderful sex, and shared their most intimate secrets.</p><p>One warm Spring day he took her to a townhouse he saw in Sunday’s New York Times. That day Tim popped the question,” Carrie continues, and it cuts to him asking her to meet his parents. “On Tuesday he called with some bad news,” his mother was unwell and they’d have to raincheck. “When she hadn’t heard from him for 2 weeks she called. He said he was up to his ears and that he’d call her the next day,” but he never called. In what’s now known as ghosting, this relationship sets up the tone for the entire series: Why are there so many great-unmarried women, and no great-unmarried men?</p><p>Clever, funny, and heartfelt at all the right times, season 1 features some storylines that probably wouldn’t make TV today, but it was a spectacular debut to one of HBOs most enduring shows.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11><h2>Season 6</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-6.jpeg><p>The final season of Sex and The City was divided into two parts: Season 6A and Season 6B. Over the course of 20 episodes, there’s a lot going on. Carrie begins with Jack Berger; a fellow writer threatened by her success and breaks up with her in the most emotionally immature way possible: a Post-It. The series closes with Mr. Big chasing Carrie to Paris, telling her: “Carrie, you’re the one” and, in the resolution of one of the most speculated mysteries of the show, we learn his name is John.</p><p>Charlotte finds her happily-ever-after with Harry (the best man on the show if you ask us) after some emotional hurdles, with the couple preparing to welcome their adopted daughter, Lilly, into the picture.</p><p>Samantha, meanwhile, finds out she has breast cancer and discovers a true, loving partner in Smith Jerrod. Miranda marries Steve and navigates balancing her career, motherhood, wifedom, and living in Brooklyn. The perfect ending, as all four women step confidently into their new lives.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Season 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-2.webp?w=650"><p>Some say season 2 of Sex and the City was better than its predecessor, and we’re inclined to agree. It’s the same SATC people loved from season 1 but felt more confident in its presentation. Carrie and Mr. Big go for round two in their tumultuous relationship, and Miranda meets Steve, her most significant love interest.</p><p>Samantha’s experimentation with monogamy doesn’t go as planned—”Me,&nbsp;James&nbsp;and his&nbsp;tiny penis are one big, happy family”—while Charlotte continues her search for love with mixed results.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Season 4</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sex-and-the-city-season-4.webp?w=650"><p>After her infidelity with Big in season 3, Aiden and Carrie reunite in what is a rather difficult relationship to watch. He still doesn’t trust her and pressures her to “lock their relationship down” with a proposal, to which Carrie is quite literally allergic because she breaks out in hives. Their doomed relationship hits a crescendo when he wants to rush their marriage and she refuses.</p><p>Charlotte reunites with Trey and they struggle to conceive, while Miranda’s pity sex with Steve after he’s diagnosed with testicular cancer ends up in pregnancy. Samantha begins her relationship with hotel magnate Richard Wright, leading to some of her most iconic moments. Season 4 has every character firing at all cylinders, gaining emotional maturity after some truly pivotal life moments.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqLK5ecCnm2asmJp6pLXTsmSsnZGovK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html&text=Best%20Sex%20and%20the%20City%20Seasons%20Ranked%3aFrom%20Pilot%20To%20Season%206&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html&title=Best%20Sex%20and%20the%20City%20Seasons%20Ranked%3aFrom%20Pilot%20To%20Season%206" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html&title=Best%20Sex%20and%20the%20City%20Seasons%20Ranked%3aFrom%20Pilot%20To%20Season%206" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html&title=Best%20Sex%20and%20the%20City%20Seasons%20Ranked%3aFrom%20Pilot%20To%20Season%206" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsex-and-the-city-seasons.html&description=Best%20Sex%20and%20the%20City%20Seasons%20Ranked%3aFrom%20Pilot%20To%20Season%206" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./china-tells-japanese-delegation-two-giants-could-complement-each-other-modern-economy-despite.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="China tells Japanese delegation two giants could complement each other in the modern economy, despit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./amerie-1-thing-debate-beyonce-j-lo-go-go-rich-harrison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Amerie's '1 Thing' Resurfaces Debate Over Beyonce, J Lo Comparisons ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
