The show has previously featured a star-studded cast including Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, Jesse Williams, Jane Lynch, Amy Schumer, and Cara Delevingne.

Speaking to People magazine, Martin revealed, "It's star-studded. And I'm going to say we're about halfway through, and we are really enjoying this season." He further added, "We think it could be one of our best seasons. Although they're all flawless."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Season 4 of Only Murders will follow the main cast searching for answers following the death of Charles’ stunt double, Sazz (Lynch), at the end of the previous installment.</p><p>“We’ve loved writing Sazz so much,” co-creator John Hoffman previously told The Hollywood Reporter. He also elaborated on his experience killing off so many beloved characters (and big names).</p><p>“Actually talking to Jane Lynch about it and saying, ‘This is what we’re thinking.’ We had to do that pretty early, too, and that was very sweet,” he said. “She was like, ‘I love it.’”</p><h3 id=6634ff79005ac><strong>More about Only Murders in the Building&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Only Murders in the Building is an American mystery-comedy television series created by Steve Martin and John Hoffman.
