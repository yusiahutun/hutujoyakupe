As she followed on in her own car, Pam frantically turned over scenarios that could explain the devastating news - a burglary gone wrong perhaps, or an accident, but her son was so fastidious with gun safety.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'When we to there the police officer told us we couldn't go into the apartment and I said, ''Can you just tell me where he was shot?

The search warrant issued at 3.14am the morning after Jonathan's death, stated the belief that: 'Brenda Lazaro has committed Murder.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later that night Pam received a phone call from Henry Su - the owner of the Kung Fu school at which Brenda taught and she and her daughter practiced.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pam said: 'He said he had gone to the police station to pick Brenda up and would I like to know what had happened because she had explained it all to him?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Su, Brenda told him that she and Jonathan had been arguing on and off all that day.
