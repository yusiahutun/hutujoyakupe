And they did.</p><p>Kaepernick has been a free agent since he was let go after the 2016 season. In November 2017, the player filed a grievance lawsuit against the NFL and its owners.</p><p>Kaepernick accused the institution and its owners of colluding to keep him out of the league.</p><p>Two years later, in February 2019, the player withdrew his grievance after reaching a confidential settlement with the National Football League.</p><h2 id=who-is-colin-kaepernick-w>Who Is Colin Kaepernick's Wife To Be, Nessa Diab?&nbsp;</h2><p>Although they are not married or engaged, Colin Kaepernick has been dating Nessa Diab since 2015.</p><p>Nessa Diab, who goes by the mononym Nessa, is an American radio and television personality and a television host.</p><p>Nessa's family is from Egypt, and she was born to an Egyptian mother and father.
